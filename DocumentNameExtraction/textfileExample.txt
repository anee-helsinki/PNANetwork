Even though the restoration as A@@u_r-re_mu_ti_ seems to be likely because of 
the space available and chronological reasons, there are other possibilities: 
A@@u_r-re_htu-u$ur (but the name seems to be too long), A@@u_r-re_manni 
(in a rarely used spelling variant) or A@@u_r-re_$u_wa (as suggested by 
Ahmad [1996] 223. However, the only attestation of the latter in Assur is as the

2. High-ranking intelligence agent based in Kumme reporting on Urar#ian activities 
(reign of Sargon II):
Most of his letters are concerned with information about the country of Urar#u, 
Assyria's rival in the north, the surveillance of which he seems to 
coordinate. He is based in Kumme, a town in the north ruled at that time by 
Arije and Ari$a^. Located there also is a royal delegate ({qe_pu|) whose 
identity is unknown (see
@@CT 53 138 and
@@CT 53 098 below). 
It is very probable that A@@ur-re$uwa, who is mentioned in both these letters, 
is this delegate.
Whether he survived the revolt in Kumme or not (see below), is not clear from 
the sources.
