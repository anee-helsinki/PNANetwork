KU]R-[i]-ti! in l. 13), buys land for eight minas of silver; the details of the land and the names of the sellers are lost SAA 6 251:4, 13 (date lost). In a letter to the king the exorcist Nabû-nadin-šumi writes that he began to perform a ritual for MÍ.KUR-i-ti as the king had ordered, but it was interrupted because he had to leave for the treaty. He asks why Šumaia hurried from Kalhu and offered to MÍ.KUR-i-ti to perform the ritual for her, complaining that it should have been left to him as Šumaia is not competent SAA 10 273:9, 15 (not dated, but may be dated in 672).

*Šaddûnu (hypocor. based on the name type “[DN is] our mountain”); Akk. (Bab.); masc.; wr. mšá-du-nu. Note that previously the name has been rendered variously as Šadanu and Kudurranu; however, the signs on the copy are clear and Šad-dûnu (typically rendered Šadûnu) is a well-attested Babylonian name (cf. also the NB ancestral name Sin-šadûnu).
Official active in Borsippa (reign of Esarhaddon or Assurbanipal): In a letter to mšá-du-nu the king orders him to gather together Šumaia and Bel-e#ir, the sons of Šumu-ukin, Aplaia, son (= descendant) of Arkat-ilani and the scholars (ummânu) of Bor-sippa in order to acquire their tablets for the royal library in Nineveh CT 22 1:1 (not dated). Parpola (1983b) 11 considers the recipient to be the gov-ernor of Borsippa; however, no governor of this name is attested for this period in other sources (cf. Frame [1992] 272-3). The letter itself is preserved only on two Late Babylonian tablets as a scribal exercise; whether or not these are based on an authentic document is not beyond question. Frame -George (2005), who present a new edition of the text (pp. 280ff), raise the possibility that the king in question is not Assurbanipal (as generally assumed) but rather Esarhaddon.

Kassite king, son of Kudur-Enlil, father of Kašti-liašu IV (1245-1233): An inscription of Sennache-rib on a clay tablet records the legend which is to be inscribed on a lapizlazuli seal. Its first owner was the Kassite king ša-ga-rak-ti—šur-ia-aš BaM 16 386: b.e. 8, r. 4 (not dated, but the text refers to Sennacherib’ s conquest of Babylon). According to the text the seal was first brought from Babylon to Assyria by the seal’s second owner, the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243-1208 BC). The orig-inal inscriptions of both kings were written on the reverse of the tablet and repeated on the obverse which also contains the instructions for the crafts-man who is to inscribe a new one for Sennacherib, the seal’s third owner. The seal must at some time have been returned to Babylon, since Sennacherib removed it from the treasury when he conquered Babylon and brought it to Assyria once again.€ Frahm (1997) 217-19 (T.180).

However, Zadok (1998) 21 translates the name Sagi-Issar as “Issar is exalted” and proposes a WSem. etymology.

*Šallim-Marduk (“Keep safe, O Marduk!”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mšal-lim—[dAMAR.UTU]. The res-toration of the name is based on the assumption that the individual is identical with Mušallim-Marduk 14. (see Donbaz [1998] 70); if this ident-ification is correct then we are dealing with an abbreviated name; if not, then other restorations are clearly possible. 
Individual from Assur (after reign of Assurbani-pal): mšal-li[m—dAMAR.UTU] sells his female slave Saki[...] for thirty shekels of silver D 88:2 = Don-baz (1998) 68-70, 77 (date lost, but cf. Mušallim-Marduk 14.).

*Šama’gunu, Samgunu (“Offspring of Agun”); hybrid WSem./Elam.; masc.; wr. mšá-ma-a’-gu-nu, mšá-ma-gu-nu, msa-am-gu-nu; Zadok (1976c) 119n, 121; Zadok (1984a) 5; the latter two writings are attested for (most likely) the same individual. 
1. Individual from Tupliaš, in the border region between Elam and Babylonia (reign of Sargon II): mšá-ma-a’-gu-nu writes a letter to the king about a man newly appointed as guard over the Qa’iš-šumateans and about the report of his messengers who had gone to Elam SAA 17 153:2 (not dated); mšá-ma-a’-[gu-nu] again writes to the king. Only a small fragment of the letter is preserved; it men-tions a certain Ia’abi-il, one of the tribal chieftains of the king of Elam SAA 17 154:2 (not dated). Ummaniša writes a letter to his “brother” mšá-ma-a’-gu-nu explaining that the latter’s envoy Aia-saggî came to him but was captured in the city centre and had no letter with him. Since Ummaniša was uncertain about the man’s credentials, he ex-plains that he has sent him back to Šama’gunu with Šama’ gunu’ s own messenger. He will not be per-mitted to return unless he carries the correct do-cumentation. Ummaniša also warns Šama’gunu not to go away, in case the king should take advant-age of his absence to capture another town SAA 17 155:2 (not dated). 
2. Gambulean, son of the Gambulean leader Bel-iqiša and younger brother of the Gambulean leader Dunanu (reign of Assurbanipal): After defeating Teumman in 653, Assurbanipal turned his atten-tion to the Elamite king’s Gambulean allies. On conquering the Gambulean city Ša-pi-Bel, Assur-banipal placed Dunanu and msa-am-gu-nu in chains and removed the remaining sons of Bel-iqiša and his entire family to Assyria and destroyed Ša-pi-Bel Prism A iii 57 // F ii 79 = Borger (1996) 39. According to another account, Assurbanipal hung the head of the Elamite Ištarnandi (Šutu(r)-nahun-di) around the neck of [m][sa-am-gu-nu], brother of Dunanu Prism C vii 49 = Borger (1996) 106; As-surbanipal brought the Gambuleans Dunanu and msa-am-gu-nu, sons of Bel-iqiša, to Assur and Ar-bail Prism B vi 76 // C vii 71 = Borger (1996) 107. 
Šama’gunu is also mentioned in a number of texts which may have been intended as captions to reliefs: Dunanu, msa-am-gu-nu and Aplaia are mentioned in a broken context Rb A2 II 10′= E r. 4′= Borger (1996) 303; Assurbanipal entered Ar-bail, taking Dunanu, msa-am-gu-nu, Aplaia and the cut-off head of Teumman Rb A1 iii 21′= G 11′= Borger (1996) 304; [Dunanu son of] Bel-iqiša (and) msa-am-gu-nu are mentioned in a broken context Rb A2 iv 12 = Borger (1996) 305. 
In a letter to the king, the Gambuleans ask for Remutu and mšá-ma-gu-nu to be installed over them ABL 915 r. 11 (not dated). The king’s re-sponse to this request is also preserved; in his letter the king consents to appoint Remutu but makes no mention of Šama’gunu ABL 293 (not dated). If ABL 915 does indeed refer to Šama’gunu, brother of Dunanu, then the letter must surely be dated after Assurbanipal’s conquest of Ša-pi-Bel and the deportation of Dunanu and Šama’gunu. His re-sponse suggests that he was willing to appease the defeated Gambuleans by partially complying with their request but he was not prepared to go so far as to reinstate the rebel Šama’gunu. If this recon-struction is correct, then it suggests either that Šama’gunu was not (yet) dead, or that the Gambu-leans did not know that he was dead (assuming that Šama’gunu was among the brothers of Dunanu whom Assurbanipal had had killed, according to his inscriptions; see Prism B vi 90ff // C vii 108ff = Borger [1996] 108). A relief from the South-West Palace, Room XXXIII, probably depicts Du-nanu and Samgunu; both men wear fetters and each has a head hanging from his neck (see Russell [1999] 180f).€ Frame (2008).

1. Eponym of the year 894 (reign of Adad-nerari II): a. In a version of the Eponym List: mdUTU—AD-u-a Eponym List 894 (A8 i 17).€ Millard (1994) 24. b. Dating an episode in a royal inscription: In the annals of Adad-nerari it is stated that during the eponymy of mdU[TU—A]D-ia the king marched to the assistance of the town Kummu and destroyed the cities Satkuru, Iasaddu, Kunnu and Tabsia, cities in the land of Habhu which had withheld tribute RIMA 2 A.0.99.2:94.

b. In the Eponym Chronicle: His name is lost but two recensions refer to an expedition to the cedar mountains during the eponymy of Šamaš-abu’a. This is borne out by passages in the royal inscrip-tions of Shalmaneser (e.g. RIMA 3 A.0.102.10 iv 15-22); the king is said to have cut down timbers there and received tribute from the rulers of Hatti Eponym Chronicle 840 (B4:2′, B10:1).€ Millard (1994) 29, 117. 
4. Prefect of the town [...]na (reign of Adad-ner-ari III): Adad-nerari grants 1,000 hectares of land in the province of the Inner City to the god Aššur, naming it Qibit-Aššur. It adjoins the town Kar-Mullissu of mdUTU—AD-u-ia LÚ*.GAR.KUR U[RU.x-x-x]-na SAA 12 1:6 (788). A restoration of the place as [Na$ibi]na seems unlikely since Šep-Issar, pre-fect of Na$ibina, is named later in the document. 
5. Son of Kakia, house owner in Maganuba (early 7th century): mdUTU—AD-u-a son of Kakia sells a house in Maganuba SAA 6 200:1 (date lost; Kwasman -Parpola [1991] 158 observe that two of the neighbouring house owners occur in Iraq 32 6, dated in 681).

The sender also reports that he is working on the construction of the fort SAA 15 113:2 (not dated); [mdUTU—EN— PAB] reports that the king of Elam is still in the mountain, in the town Burati SAA 15 114:2 (not dated); [m]dUTU—EN—P AB again reports that the king of Elam is in the mountain; much of the letter is lost SAA 15 115:2 (not dated); [mdUTU—EN—PAB] writes about various men who are on their way to see the king SAA 15 117:2 (not dated); [mdUTU— EN—P A B] confirms that he has put inside the fort all of the straw which the king sent, just as the king ordered; he has also brought in barley rations, and says that nobody has gone out of Der to cultivate grain. He is also keeping watch over the Man-direans who are inside the fort, just as the king advised SAA 15 119:2 (not dated); mdUTU—[EN]— PAB writes about the people in charge of the Lab-dudeans; the king had ordered their prefect Balassu to give them back to their owners. The author reports that he is sending a list of their names to the king. He also recommends that some other people be returned to their masters, so that the latter can be induced to work because at the mo-ment they are distracted by the absence of their people SAA 15 121:2 (not dated); mdUTU—EN—PAB writes about hauling thresholds from Labdudu SAA 15 122:2 (not dated); [mdUTU—EN—PAB] writes that he has been transporting logs from Argada for three months now; he has also received orders via a bodyguard to raise 400 door-beams and haul a threshold stone from Iasubu, which he is about to do SAA 15 123:2 (not dated); a poorly preserved letter of [mdUTU—EN—PAB] mentions various per-sonnel, including two men from Dur-Ladini SAA 15 126:2 (not dated); mdUTU—EN—PAB writes to the king about a lawsuit; the details are mostly lost SAA 15 127:2 (not dated). A number of other letters have been ascribed to Šamaš-belu-u$ur though the opening section is lost: the author re-ports that he has managed to assure inhabitants of the town Gabê that it is safe to come down from the mountain; he also says that he is gathering troops in Meturna SAA 15 116 (not dated); the author reports that Elamite troops have besieged Malak and some of the fugitives have sought re-fuge in Der; the herald (of Elam) gathered the local inhabitants and confined them in a temple.

i. In the correspondence of other officials: 
1′. During his office as governor of Arzuhina: In a letter to the governor (of Kalhu) Aššur-taklak writes that a message has come from the governor of Arzuhina for Nanî; it concerns the corn-taxes of the governor of Kalhu. The sender also repeats what he has heard the farmers say, that [m]dUTU— EN—PAB LÚ*.EN.NAM [x (x) x] is taking something (details lost); he is surely to be identified with the governor of Arzuhina mentioned earlier in the let-ter CTN 2 196 r. 6 (not dated). In a report on the delivery of barley of the magnates to various towns, the author writes that on the 19th and 20th he delivered [that of the governor of Ar]zuhina; the same passage mentions [m][d]UTU—EN—(PAB), pres-umably the governor himself, in a broken context SAA 1 170:11 (not dated). 
2′. During his office as governor of Der: In a letter to the king Issar-duri (governor of Arrapha) writes that mdUTU—EN—PAB has written to him from Der, asking whether they should really not put any inscriptions in the walls of the temple. The author suggests that the king have an inscription written as a model, so they can write inscriptions accord-ingly and put them in the temple SAA 15 4:17 (not dated); an unknown author writes to the king about difficulties with the transportation of some oxen and sheep from Der and other matters; mdUTU—EN— P AB is mentioned in a broken context SA A 15 37 r. 5 (not dated); mdUTU—EN—PAB is mentioned in a broken context in a letter which also mentions some traitors staying with Lutû (son of Daltâ of Ellipi) SAA 15 62:17 (not dated); in a Babylonian letter to the king, Nabû-šumu-lešir and Aqar-Bel-lumur write that a mounted messenger of mdUTU— EN—ŠEŠ [LÚ.qí]-pi! šá BÀD.DINGIR.KI arrived with news that the king of Elam was on his way and that they should take refuge in the forts SAA 17 120:9 (not dated); possibly identical with 5.€ Millard (1994) 47, 118.

6. Chief of the levy(?) (reign of Sargon II): In an administrative document various metal items are said to be assigned to mdUTU—EN—PAB LÚ*.GAL— bat-qi ND 2374 r. 2 (719). Note that the edition reads LÚ.GAL—pít-qi with the translation “overseer of the designers”. 
7. Individual from Kalhu (8th century): In an administrative document concerned with “first fruit” offerings, mdUTU—U—PAB is among the men listed; the details of his contribution are lost ND 3486 i 7 (not dated or date lost).

1. Assyrian official active in Babylonia during the time of the Mukin-zeri rebellion (reign of Ti-glath-pileser III): a. As the author of letters to the king: m[d][UTU]— DÙ-a-a and Nabû-nammir write a letter to the king reporting on their negotiations with the citizens of Babylon which proved to be unsuccessful. The Babylonian notables refused to speak with them and they were not allowed to enter the city, having been told that the gate would only be opened for the king himself. They thus withdrew to Kar-Ner-gal to await the king’s arrival. They write that the Litamu tribe has remained loyal and its leaders plan to go before the Assyrian king. The letter also contains a poorly preserved report on the city of Dilbat which mentions Mukin-zeri ND 2632:2 = NL 1 = CTN 5 19-21 (not dated); [mdUTU—bu-na-a-a], Nabû-nammir and the men of Babylon write a letter to the king; the contents are mostly lost but the letter cites the king’s command that they should not make him (i.e. Mukin-zeri) fight until the king is able to muster against him all of the troops stationed in the vicinity of Babylon ND 2403:1 = CTN 5 74f (not dated); mdUTU—bu-na-[a-a] writes to the king about the movements of Itu’ean and Ru’ean soldiers; the letter, which is badly broken, also mentions the road of Kar-Šamaš and the events in Babylon ND 2663:2 = NL 8 = CTN 5 26-8 (not dated); mdUTU—bu-na-a-a writes to the king about his journey from Marad to Parak-mari where he checked and received the people who had formerly been in the care of the people of Nippur and Larak. He plans to set out from Larak on the 1st and will come to the king ND 2628:2 = NL 76 = CTN 5 30f (not dated); in a letter to the king, mdUTU—bu-na-a-a reports about people (poss-ibly deportees) who have been sent to the king ND 2630:1 = CTN 5 28-30 (not dated). 
b. Mentioned in letters of other officials to the king: Aššur-šallimanni, governor of Arrapha, writes to the king about his difficulty in provision-ing the 6,000 captives whom the king placed under his authority. As he has no barley, he asks that 6,000-3,000 homers be given to him and also that 3,000 homers be given to mdUTU—[DÙ]-a-a ND 2634 r. 8; he then anticipates that the king will ask how they (the captives) are to be brought before mdUTU—DÙ-a-a ND 2634 r. 18; he says that there are 150 walled towns of mdUTU—DÙ-a-a in Arrapha (province); they may be brought there ND 2634 r. 21 = NL 96 = CTN 5 49-51 (not dated); possibly identical with 2. and/or 3. 
2. Assyrian official (reign of Tiglath-pileser III or Sargon II): In a fragment of a letter concerned with the disposition of men, donkeys and camels, mdUTU—DÙ-[a-a] (edition: Šamaš-ibni) is said to have fifty-nine (men), fifty-nine (donkeys) and one camel assigned to him; the letter’s author says that he is now sending them to the king via Apladad-[...] ND 2366 r.2 = NL 60 = CTN 5 241-2(not dated); possibly identical with 1. and/or 3. 
3. Official active in Babylonia (reign of Sen-nacherib): A letter to the vizier attributed to Lanšê (stationed in Gambulu) refers to the days of mdUTU—bu-na-a-[a] SAA 17 95:4 (not dated, but see Dietrich [2003] xxvii); possibly identical with 1. and/or 2.

2. Governor of Babylon, post-canonical eponym of the year 645* (reign of Assurbanipal): a. Title: Šamaš-da’’inanni is referred to as gov-ernor (šakin mati) of the land Akkad (LÚ.GAR.KUR KUR.URI.KI, LÚ.GAR.KUR URI.KI and LÚ.GAR.KUR KUR.URI) and as governor (pahatu) of Babylon (LÚ.NAM KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI); probably both of these titles refer to the governorship of the province of Babylon, rather than the whole of Babylonia (Frame [1992] 226f). A recently published tablet adds to these previously attested writings of his title: L[Ú*.G]AR KÁ.[DINGIR.RA.KI] (BA TSH 6 50 l.e. 2). He was most likely appointed to this office after the end of the Šamaš-šumu-ukin revolt, fol-lowing the conquest of Babylon.

8′. Dating a section of a cultic text: On the 12th day of the month Šaba#u (xi.) during the eponymy of mdUTU—KALAG-an-[ni] several gods in the city are said to have “risen (from their old dwellings) and sat down in their (new) houses” Menzel (1981) T66 r. ix 50′.€ Frame (1992) 341 (index); Millard (1994) 118. 
c. In a royal letter: In a Babylonian letter to an unknown recipient the king writes that when he sent mdUTU—KALAG-i[n-an-ni] to the city Šamunu, certain local sheikhs and peoples rebelled CT 54 567:12′(not dated). The letter describes the suc-cess of Assurbanipal’s fourth Elamite campaign (= his first campaign against Ummanaldašu III), namely the capture of a brother of the Elamite king and of the wife and children of Teumman in Bit-Imbî (this episode is also mentioned in the royal inscriptions of Assurbanipal; see Borger [1996] 46f, 237f; Waters [2000] 70f). 
d. As a protagonist in a Babylonian legal docu-ment: [mdUTU—di-na-an-ni LÚ].[GAR].[KUR URI.KI] was involved in a legal dispute with Kudurru, gov-ernor of Uruk, over some Puqudeans who had been dedicated to Ištar and Nanaya by Sargon and Sen-nacherib and whose status had since been con-firmed by Esarhaddon BIN 2 132:12 (collation by Brinkman [1984] 105f n. 526; cf. Frame [1992] 201 n. 48). Both of these authors consider it likely that this attestation refers to Šamaš-da’’inanni. If the writing of his name is not simply a scribal error, it is perhaps possible that the Assyrian verbal form da’’inanni was misinterpreted in Babylonian (where it would be dunninanni) as dinanni (“render judgement for me!”).

The following letter to the king was written after the death of Šamaš-ibni since it mentions his suc-cessor, Nabû-ušallim: Inurta-ahu-[...] reports on Nabû-ušallim of Bit-Dakkuri; he says that Nabû-ušallim has refused to hand over to him the rene-gade scholars, eunuchs and soldiers of mdUTU—ib-ni who are with him unless he is presented with a sealed document from the king and a bodyguard SAA 18 56:9 (not dated).

Esarhaddon returned the fields to their rightful owners and installed Nabû-ušallim, son of Balassu, on his (Šamaš-ibni’ s) throne. Šamaš-ibni was deported to Assyria and executed in 678, ac-cording to the Esarhaddon Chronicle (Grayson [2000] 126, Chron.14:10; cf. p. 83, Chronicle 1 iv 1).

Royal prince, son of king Esarhaddon (reigns of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal): a.

Those bound by the treaty are obliged to report any threat to Assurbanipal SAA 2 8:4 (not dated or date lost). The treaty must have been drawn up in the short interval between the death of Esarhaddon and the coronation of Assurbanipal (Parpola [1987] 168).

NU11—(UG5).GA—TI.LA and Sin-šar-ahhešu SAA 7 149 iii 3 (date lost). Weissert suggests (s.v. Aššur-bani-apli [section I.1.h.]) that Šamaš-metu-uballi# was the third oldest son of Esarhaddon, after Sin-nadin-apli and Šamaš-šumu-ukin. He also notes that his name implies a sickly physique, which perhaps explains why Esarhaddon passed him over in favour of Assurbanipal.

Dating documents from Nineveh: mdUTU— MAN—DÙ LÚ.tur-tan-n[u] SAA 14 435 l.e. 1; mdUTU—MAN—DÙ SAA 14 173 b.e. 8; SAA 14 434 r. 6; SAA 14 446 r. 6; mšá-maš—MAN—DÙ SAA 14 172:7. mdUTU—[MAN—DÙ] is a likely restoration for the eponym dating SAA 14 447 r. 7. The archival context (see Inurta-šarru-u$ur 2.) indicates that he is an eponym of the post-canonical era; the most likely restoration therefore is Šamaš-šarru-ibni since the other possibility, Šamaš-da’’inanni (645*), falls almost a decade before the earliest datable tablet from this archive which spans the period 636*-612*.

Son of king Esarhaddon, brother of king Assur-banipal, ruler of Babylonia from 668 until his re-bellion of 652 (reigns of Esarhaddon and Assur-banipal): Šamaš-šumu-ukin was appointed by his father Esarhaddon as heir to the throne of Babylon in Ayyaru (II) 672, at the same time as his younger brother Assurbanipal was designated heir to the throne of Assyria. In early 668, following Esarhad-don’s death in VIII-669, Šamaš-šumu-ukin took the throne of Babylon, according to the Babylonian Chronicle (see below) which he occupied until his death in 648, four years into the rebellion which he had instigated in 652. 
a. During the reign of king Esarhaddon and im-mediately after his death: 1′. In treaties and loyalty oaths: Esarhaddon’s Succession Treaty, preserved in eight exemplars found in the Nabû Temple at Kalhu (also known as the “Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon”), contains provisions in case of the king’s untimely death while his sons were still minors. The parties to the Treaty were enjoined to help Assurbanipal, the great crown prince, to take the throne of Assyria, and to help mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA ŠEŠ ta-li-me-šú DUMU—MAN šá É—UŠ-ti šá KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI (“his equal(?) brother, the crown prince designate of Babylon”) to ascend the throne of Babylon SAA 2 6:86; the colophon of the Treaty describes the document as “The Treaty of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, concluded on behalf of Assurbanipal, the great crown prince designate of Assyria, and mdGIŠ. NU11—MU—GI.NA DUMU—MAN (GAL) šá É—UŠ-ti [šá] KÁ.DINGIR.RA .KI (the crown prince designate of Babylon)” SAA 2 6:668 (672). 
A broken passage of Esarhaddon’s Treaty In-scription states that he (the king) took the hand of Assurbanipal, crown prince designate, and of [mdUT]U—[MU—GIN] DUMU—LUGAL É—re-du-[ti šá KÁ.DINGIR.RA .KI] (“crown prince designate of Bab-ylon”) SAA 2 14 i 12 (not dated or date lost).€ Parpola -Watanabe (1988) xxxiv (on the back-ground to the inscription and its relationship with the Succession Treaty, dated in 672). 
In the so-called Zakutu Treaty the mother of Esarhaddon attempts to secure the succession of her favourite grandson Assurbanipal following the death of Esarhaddon. The treaty is said to have been drawn up with mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—G[I].NA, “his equal brother” (PAB ta-li-me-šú), and with Šamaš-metu-uballi# and the rest of his brothers and other members of the royal family, as well as with the magnates and governors, the bearded and eunuchs, the royal entourage, all who enter the palace, and all the Assyrians SAA 2 8:3 (not dated or date lost).€ Parpola -Watanabe (1988) xxxif. 
2′. As the author of letters to the king: mdGIŠ. NU11—MU—GI.N[A] reports to the king that (A)šaredu and Nabû-ahhe-ereš of Babylon and Bel-iddina of Borsippa have sent him a letter com-plaining that certain men are neglecting the king’s (loyalty) treaty and have made common cause with those who were involved in capturing Aššur-nadin-šumi and delivering him to Elam SAA 16 21:2 (not dated); mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA writes a very brief letter mentioning one horse from (the governor of) Ra$appa and one sheep from Nabû-bani-ahhe; probably they are audience gifts SAA 16 22:2 (not dated); [mdGIŠ].NU11—MU—GI.NA writes a letter of which only the greeting formula is partly preserved SAA 16 24:2 (not dated); mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—[GI.NA] writes a letter whose contents are mostly lost SAA 16 23:2 (not dated). 
3′. In the scholarly correspondence: The chief exorcist Marduk-šakin-šumi reports in a letter to the king that the crown prince is well and that mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA is well SAA 10 238:6 (not dated; the edition suggests a date of 672-671). Another letter of Marduk-šakin-šumi mentions mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA in a badly broken context; the letter concerns someone who is sick, possibly Šamaš-šumu-ukin himself SAA 10 239:4 (not dated). In a letter to the king the exorcist Urdu-Gula expresses the wish that the gods whom the king reveres shall stand by the king and by Assur-banipal and by mdGIŠ.NU—MU—GI.NA on (the day of) their trial SAA 10 289:5 (not dated; the edition suggests a date of 672-671); in a letter the king’s exorcist [Adad-šuma-u$ur] reports to the king that mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA is doing well; they are plan-ning to perform a ritual for the crown prince, but there is no need to perform it for mdGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA at the same time; the king is asked what are his orders SAA 10 193:13, r. 2 (not dated; the edition suggests a date of 672-669); Adad-šuma-u$ur reports in another letter that Assurbanipal is doing very well, [mdGIŠ.NU11—M]U—GIN-i[n] is doing very well, and Aššur-etel-šamê-er$eti-mu-ballissu is also doing very well SAA 10 223:9 (not dated; the edition suggests a date of 669); in a letter to the king [Mar-Issar] reports that the substitute king died with his queen; he died as a substitute for the king, and for the sake of the life of mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.[NA] SAA 10 352:11 (not dated; the edition suggests a date of XI/XII-671); [Urdu-Nanaia] re-sponds to the king’ s enquiry as to why A dad-šumu-u$ur had said that the crown prince and mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA should not go out of doors before the 2nd of Tašritu (VII); the writer’s explanation is mostly lost SAA 10 314:7 (not dated; the edition suggests a date in VI/VII-671); Ikkaru writes to the king that mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA is doing much bet-ter; he details the treatment he plans to give, and writes that thanks to Bel, Nabû and the Lady of Life, the flesh of mdGIŠ.NU—MU—GI.NA is much bet-ter SAA 10 328 r. 12, 19 (not dated). 
4′. In the priestly correspondence: Urdu-Nabû writes to the king about offerings for the king and his family; he says that he has given instructions about the offerings for Assurbanipal, the great crown prince, for mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA DUMU— MAN KÁ.DINGIR, and for Šeru’a-e#irat, Aššur-mukin-pale’a and Aššur-etel-šame-er$eti-muballis-su SAA 13 56 r. 7 (not dated). 
5′. In an astrological report: Towards the end of a report Akkullanu says that he had performed burnt offerings on behalf of the king, the crown prince and mdGIŠ.N[U11—MU—GI.NA] SAA 8 102 r. 11 (not dated or date lost; the edition suggests a date in 669). 
6′. In the royal inscriptions of Esarhaddon: A fragment of a tablet concerns the installation of Šamaš-šumu-ukin in Babylon. The text states: “I gave [mdGIŠ.NU11]—MU—GI.NA, (my) son, my off-spring, as a present to the god Marduk and the goddess Zarpanitu” RINAP 4 53:10′(AsBbG). A cylinder from Babylon commemorating the re-building of the temple of Nabû-ša-harê mentions Assurbanipal, crown prince of Assyria, and mdGIŠ. 
NU11—MU—GI.NA DUMU—ri-du-te KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI RINAP 4 113:30. Both texts must have been com-posed after 672. 
7′. In a schedule of offerings for members of the royal family and temple personnel from the city of Assur: mGIŠ.NU11—MU—[GI].NA is listed with five sutu Ass 13956bq:17 = AfO 13 Taf. 4 = Menzel (1981) T17f. 
8′. In the Babylonian Chronicle: The entry for 669/8 records the death of Esarhaddon en route to Egypt on 10-VIII, having reigned for twelve years. In the following month, Kislimu (IX), his son As-surbanipal took the throne of Assyria and dGIŠ. NU11—MU—GI.NA took the throne in Babylon Borger (1956) 124, Chron. 669/8. The entry for the follow-ing year refers to the accession of dGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA Borger (1956) 125, Chron. 668/7.€ Grayson (1975) 86. 
b. During the reign of king Assurbanipal: 1′. Prior to the Babylonian revolt which began in 652: a′. As the author of letters to his brother, king Assurbanipal: mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA writes to the king about the passage of some boats; the letter mentions the Elamite prince Ummanigaš (Hum-ban-nikaš) as well as Bel-iqiša (leader of the Gam-bulu) whose letter has come into his hands and is being forwarded to the king ABL 1385:2 (not dated).€ Frame (1992) 111 (on the background and interpretation of the letter). mdGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA writes to his brother the king that he has been hearing rumours about Sin-balassu-iqbi, governor of Ur; he suggests that Assurbanipal detain the man until he finds out what the situation is; he will write to the king ABL 426:2 (not dated); [mdGIŠ].NU11— MU—G[I.NA] writes a letter to his brother the king; the contents are lost, apart from a mention of “these people” ABL 809:1 (not dated); m[d?][GIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA] writes a letter to his brother, king As-surbanipal; again, the contents are lost CT 53 140:2 (not dated). 
b′. In the inscriptions of Assurbanipal: An in-scription of Assurbanipal refers to the king’s in-stallation of mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA ŠEŠ ta-li-mì in Babylon L4 iii 5 = Lehmann-Haupt (1892) pl. xxxivff; cf. Borger (1996) 187f; later on the same text mentions [m][d]GIŠ.NU11—MU—GI in a broken context L4 iv 14′. A number of Babylonian inscrip-tions of Assurbanipal also refer to his brother: Assurbanipal claims that he installed mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA as king of Babylon so that the strong might not oppress the weak RIMB 2 6.32.1:13 // 5:11 // 6:14 // 12:11 // 14:31 // 19:18; mdGIŠ.[NU11]— MU—GI.NA RIMB 2 6.32.2:52; mdGIŠ.NU11—[MU]— GI.NA RIMB 2 6.32.4:11; [mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA] RIMB 2 6.32.13:16. Some inscriptions express a wish for the long life of mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—[GI].[NA] // [mdGI]Š.[NU11]—[MU]—GI.NA, king of Babylon RIMB 2 6.32.2:74 // 4:19; mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA RIMB 2 6.32.5:19 // 6:24 // 12:21 // 14:46 // 19:27. 
c′. In the Babylonian inscriptions of Šamaš-šumu-ukin himself: 1′′. Sippar: Cylinder with bilingual inscription describing the renovation of the city wall: dGIŠ. NU11—MU—GI.NA LUGAL KALA-GA dGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA LUGAL dan-nu RIMB 2 6.33.1:1; dGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA (bis) RIMB 2 6.33.1:33.

3′′. Ur: In a dedicatory inscription of Sin-šarru-u$ur “for the good health of” mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA RIMB 2 6.33.2001:2. Sin-šarru-u$ur held the posi-tion of governor of Ur for only a short time before and after the outbreak of rebellion in 652; his predecessor (and brother) Sin-balassu-iqbi had only mentioned Assurbanipal in his inscriptions, so perhaps loyalty to Šamaš-šumu-ukin was a fac-tor in Sin-šarru-u$ur’ s removal from office. 
4′′. Other Babylonian sources dating from Šamaš-šumu-ukin’ s reign: For a summary see Frame (2008) 621. 
d′. In queries to the sun-god: A query asks Šamaš whether [mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA] // mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA, son of Esarhaddon, should escort the statue of Marduk into Babylon SAA 4 262:2, r. 6 (668). 
2′. During the Babylonian revolt of 652-c. 647: a′. In the inscriptions of Assurbanipal: The trea-chery of mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA, Assurbanipal’s disloyal brother, who was not mindful of all the favours done to him, is reported at length Prism A iii 70 = Borger (1996) 39; mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA, disloyal brother, not mindful of his loyalty agree-ment, caused the lands of Akkad, Chaldea, Aramu, and the Sealand, from the town Aqabu to the town Bab-salimetu, the king’s loyal servants, to rebel Prism A iii 96 = Borger (1996) 40; in his sixth campaign (according to Prism A), Assurbanipal mustered his troops and directed them against mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA Prism A iii 129 = Borger (1996) 41. After Tammaritu had occupied the throne of Elam in place of Ummanigaš, he did not ask after Assurbanipal’s well-being but rather went to the assistance of Assurbanipal’s enemy brother mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA Prism A iv 6 = Borger (1996) 42; but after Tammaritu was deposed by Indabibi, he sought — and was granted — refuge at Assurbanipal’s court. At that time, the people of Akkad who were allied with mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA were afflicted by famine and compelled to eat the flesh of their sons and daughters Prism A iv 42 = Borger (1996) 43; the gods of Assurbanipal cast his enemy brother mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA into a fire and he died Prism A iv 50 = Borger (1996) 43; cf. Prism C ix 24 = Borger (1996) 152; mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA, enemy brother whom the king had treated favourably and installed as king of Baby-lon, but who forgot the favour shown him and turned the lands of Akkad, Chaldea and Arumu, (formerly) loyal servants, against Assurbanipal in denial of brotherhood — Enlil, Marduk and the other gods saw his evil deeds and came to Assur-banipal’s assistance, causing him to be struck by fire and burnt IIT:110 = Fuchs (1996) 279. As for those people who had plotted with mdGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA, hostile brother, but who had not perished by fire together with their lord mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA but had evaded death by fire, sword or famine — not one of them escaped Prism A iv 53, 57 = Borger (1996) 44. The people of the lands of Akkad, Chal-dea, Aramu and Sealand, whom mdGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.NA had acquired as allies and turned against Assurbanipal, now were forced to submit to the king again and he installed governors and dele-gates over them Prism A iv 98 = Borger (1996) 45. 
In his description of the sack of Susa in 647, Assurbanipal mentions treasures including the royal apparel of the previous kings of Akkad and those which mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA sent to Elam (as bribes) to acquire support Prism A vi 14 // F v 8 = Borger (1996) 53. 
When Assurbanipal received the corpse of Nabû-bel-šumati he did not allow it to be buried but cut off the head and hung it around the neck of Nabû-qati-$abat, simmagir-official of mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA Prism A vii 48 = Borger (1996) 60. 
The Arab king Uaite’ (Iauta’) had given military forces to Abi-Iate’ and Aia-ammu son(s) of Te’ri and had sent them to the assistance of mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—GI.NA Prism A vii 99 = Borger (1996) 61; Assurbanipal inflicted a defeat upon Abi-Iate’ and Aia-ammu, son(s) of Te’ri, who had entered Bab-ylon to assist mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA Prism A viii 32 = Borger (1996) 63. The others who had entered Babylon were forced by famine to eat one another, and they fled Babylon to save their lives. Assur-banipal’s forces who were arrayed against mGIŠ. NU11—MU—GI.NA inflicted a second defeat upon him (Abi-Iate’) Prism A viii 40 = Borger (1996) 63. He fled alone to save his life and submitted to Assur-banipal who showed mercy on him and installed him in place of Uaite’ (Iauta’) son of Haza-il as king of Arabia. 
A fragmentary passage refers to mdGIŠ.NU11—MU— GI.N[A] whom Assurbanipal had installed as king of Babylon but who became hostile Prism C vii 120 = Borger (1996) 148.

A fragment of a letter refers to a Ru’ean and to the forces of dGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.N[A] CT 54 208 r. 5 (not dated); a very fragmentary letter to the king from multiple authors mentions mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—G[I.NA] CT 54 437:3 (not dated). A letter mentions a cer-tain Nabû-na$ir, son of Mukin-zeri, whom [mG]IŠ. NU11—MU—GI.NA appointed to the governorship of Uruk; the senders report that he and another man has been captured and put in fetters and handed over to Nabû-ušabši(?) CT 54 496:4 (not dated). In a letter which may be attributed to Bel-uballi# of Uruk, [m]dGIŠ.N[U11—MU—GI.NA] is mentioned in a broken context, as is Nabû-bel-šumati; the writer also reports what the messengers of Nabû-bel-šumati who went before mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA said while he was in Babylon ABL 1326:2, r. 6 (not dated). Another letter to the king (name of sender lost, possibly written from Uruk) mentions mdGIŠ. NU11—MU—[GI.NA] in a broken context together with a messenger of the [delegate] of the land Arašu ABL 1309 r. 2 (not dated). In a letter the author reminds the king that in the beginning he had told the king that mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA was hostile when he heard about something ABL 960:14 (not dated). 
f′. In literary compositions: In a text purporting to give the god Aššur’s response to Assurbanipal’s report on the Šamaš-šumu-ukin war, the god states that because of the evil deeds which [mdGIŠ.NU11— MU—G]I.NA committed against Assurbanipal, he pulled out the foundations of his royal throne and overthrew his reign and commanded the destruc-tion of the land of Akkad SAA 3 44:3; as for mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.NA, who did not keep Aššur’s treaty but sinned against the charity of Assurbani-pal, Aššur imprisoned him and led his magnates to Assyria, to Assurbanipal’s presence SAA 3 44:7; [mdGIŠ.N]U11—MU—GI.NA [overlooked] Aššur’s curse and did not heed advice SAA 3 44:14; as for [mdGIŠ.NU11—MU—GI.N]A?, who took away the property of the gods, Aššur decreed an evil fate for him SAA 3 44:18. A literary letter praising Assur-banipal mentions [mdGIŠ.N]U11—MU—GI.NA in a broken context SAA 3 25 i 13.€ Frame (2008).

Post-canonical eponym: mdUTU—NUMUN—TI dates a single legal document from Kalhu ND 3405 r. 10 (625*). Millard (1994) 119 apparently as-sumes that this is a scribal error for the post-ca-nonical eponym Šamaš-metu-uballi#; however, it is now clear that all of the attestations that he lists under that name should rather be read Šarru-metu-
uballi#, eponym of the year 640*. Therefore we seem to be dealing with an otherwise unattested eponym, presumably of the post-canonical era.

b′. In a collection of decrees of Šamši-Adad V and Adad-nerari III: [mdUTU-ši—dIM] is restored as having made a poorly preserved grant SAA 12 76:5; in the same text [Adad-nerari], son of mšam-ši—dIM, makes a grant to the Sebetti and Kadmuri temples dated in 797 SAA 12 76:8; [Adad-nerari], son of mšam-ši—dIM, makes another grant which is poorly preserved but may be dated in 793 SAA 12 76:24; at the end of the text it is stated that these are the decrees which mšam-ši—dIM and Adad-ner-ari established SAA 12 76:34 (not dated or date lost, but after 793).

In three copies of the Eponym List: mMAN— IGI.LAL-an-ni // mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-an-ni // mMAN— IGI.LAL-a-ni :. (for GAR.KUR) KUR.za-mu-[a] Epo-nymList712(A1v12,A4ii7,A9i18).€Millard (1994) 47. 
2′. Dating the colophon of literary texts found at Nineveh: [Šarru-emuranni] GAR.KUR KUR.lul-lu-mi-e Hunger (1968) no. 294(U) = 3R 2:7; [Šarru-emuranni LÚ.GAR].KUR KUR.lul-lu-mi-e Sm 2101.€ Millard (1994) 120. 
3′. In a memorandum found at Nineveh: Events dated to the eponym years of mMAN—e-mur-an-ni and Aššur-bani (713 BC) are mentioned in a frag-mentary memorandum SAA 11 150 r. 4. 
b. In the correspondence of Sargon II: The letters found in the royal correspondence provide ample information on the duties of the governor of Maza-mua, the oldest of the Assyrian provinces in the Zagros, closest to the heart of Assyria and hence in an ideal position to communicate with and to access the other Zagros provinces Bit-Humban, Parsua, Kar-Nergal and Kar-Šarrukin as well as the independent kingdoms of Allabria, Elippi and Mannea. At the end of the 8th century, the Zagros was Assyria’s most important source of horses; many of Šarru-emuranni’s letters are concerned with this topic. 
1′. As the author of letters to the king: a′. The following letters specifically concern the Zagros region (see also below, 2é. and 3é.), in-cluding the procuring of horses from this area: mLUGAL—e-mur-an-ni explains to the king why he did not wait for the governor of Arrapha in order to set out on a campaign to Parsua; mention is also made of his deputy Nabû-hamatu’a and “the son of Bel-iddina” (i.e., the king of Allabria) and their role in a future expedition SAA 5 199:2 (not dated); mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-[an-ni] presents to the king his views concerning the organization of a campaign to Bit-Hamban; he also asks the king to make sure that “the son of Bel-iddina” (i.e., the king of Allabria) will support the expedition properly, citing last year’s campaign, when he kept the best men at home, as a negative example SAA 5 200:2 (not dated); mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-ni replies to the king’s demand for a special breed of horses to be found in the Zagros; the letter also concerns the people of Kibatki who incurred the vengeance of the Assyrian army owing to their refusal to send horses to Assyria SAA 5 202:2 (not dated); [Šarru-emuranni] informs the king about passing on a royal message from the bodyguard Nabû-ahu-u$ur (see also SAA 5 226, below) to the Mannean for-tress Izirtu SAA 5 204 (date lost); mLUGAL— IGI.LAL-ni reports on dealings with Kar-Nergal (Kišessim) SAA 5 207:2 (not dated); another letter fragment which may be attributed to Šarru-emu-ranni concerns horses SAA 5 208 (name lost). 
b′. The following letters deal with a variety of other topics: A fragmentary letter o mLUGAL—e-mur-[an-ni] to the king seems to contain information on Arzuhina SAA 5 201:2 (not dated); mLUGAL— IGI.LAL-ni reacts to various requests of the king, including the matter of wine for the soldiers, the interaction with one Kubabu-satar, as well as asking for guidance on how to deal with the con-
sequences of the recent debt remission in Babylon SAA 5 203:2 (not dated); a fragmentary letter of mMAN—IGI.[LAL-ni] to the king concerns various kinds of stone, probably to be provided from the Zagros, and refers to a conversation he had with the king in Kalhu SAA 5 205:2 (not dated); mLUGAL— e-mur-an-ni informs the king about handling vast amounts of bronze as well as linen garments des-tined for Dur-Šarrukin SAA 5 206:2 (not dated; this letter may alternatively be authored by the military official active in Babylonia, see 6. below); another fragment contains nothing beyond the mention of its sender, mMAN—[IGI.LAL-ni] SAA 5 209:2 (not dated). It seems likely that a letter found in Nimrud was also authored by this man: m[MAN!]— IG[I].LAL-an-ni answers a royal letter concerning his namesake Šarru-emuranni’ s (probably 5., the governor of Bit-Zamani) involvement in the con-struction work at Dur-Šarrukin SAA 5 292:2 (not dated). 
2′. Mentioned in a letter of Mannu-ki-Ninua, governor of Kar-Šarrukin (i.e., Harhar): Mannu-ki-Ninua informs the king about the highly secret arrangements concerning Lutû, the son of Daltâ, king of Ellipi. As arranged, Mannu-ki-Ninua went to meet mMAN—IGI-a-ni who entrusted Lutû to him, and Mannu-ki-Ninua then brought the prince in-cognito to Kar-Šarrukin SAA 15 100:9 (not dated); these events took place after Daltâ’s death and during the succession struggle between his nephews Ašpa-bara and Nibê in Ellipi. 
3′. Mentioned in a letter of the royal bodyguard Nabû-ahu-u$ur: Nabû-ahu-u$ur was employed as an envoy of the king to communicate with the eastern governors (see also SAA 5 204 above). In a letter to the king, he informs the king of the reaction of m[MAN]—IGI-ni and his deputy Nabû-ha-matu’a to the king’s orders to deliver the horses they have collected as tribute; they do not want to come themselves but suggest giving them to the deputy governor of Bit-Hamban on his way to the king; they also want to keep more than the fifty riding horses allowed by the king SAA 5 226:16 (not dated). 
4′. Mentioned in a letter of Salmanu-[...]: When reclaiming his investments from the king, Salma-nu-[...] names mLU[GAL—IGI.LAL-an-ni] whose completion of half his work assignment in Dur-Šarrukin seems to constitute an argument in favour of his request SAA 1 159 r. 13 (not dated); this text might alternatively refer to 5., the homonymous governor of Bit-Zamani, or to 6., the military offi-cial active in Babylonia. 
c. In administrative documents from Kalhu: Hor-ses of various breeds are attributed to [m]LUGAL— IGI.LAL-ni and the city of Arzuhina in an adminis-trative list from Kalhu CTN 3 116:5 (not dated); ten team commanders and their commanding offi-cers are listed as being under the authority of mMAN—IGI.LAL-a-ni CTN 3 99 ii 6 (not dated, but cf. Dalley -Postgate [1984] 176); 65 horses and their commanding officers are attributed to mMAN— IGI.[LAL-a-ni] in an administrative document from Kalhu; the names of these officers are identical with those given in the first source mentioned CTN 3 108 iii 13 (not dated). Note that Dalley -Postgate (1984) 172f suggest the possibility that the gov-ernor of Mazamua was transferred to Babylonia during Sargon’s campaign of 710-708 BC; if this is correct, then 4. and 6. should be combined. 
5. Governor of Bit-Zamani (reign of Sargon II): a. As author of a letter to the king: mLUGAL— IGI.LAL-a-ni, clearly identified as the governor of Bit-Zamani on the Upper Tigris because of a dis-tinctive greeting formula mentioning the province, reports on matters of horse-breeding and hay-har-vesting; he also asks for an audience with the king during his visit to Dur-Šarrukin in order to inspect the progress on the building works he is respon-sible for SAA 5 47:2 (not dated). 
b. Mentioned in a letter to the king: It is likely that it is he who is mentioned in a letter of another Šarru-emuranni (probably 4., the governor of Ma-zamua), a reaction to an earlier letter from the king informing him of the progress of the building work of mMAN—IGI.LAL-[an-ni] (mMAN—IGI.LAL-[an]-ni in r. 7) in Dur-Šarrukin SAA 5 292:5 (not dated). 
c. The following attestations possibly refer to the governor of Bit-Zamani, but might equally well pertain to another individual with high military responsibility: 1′. Possibly mentioned in administrative docu-ments from Kalhu: Seven team commanders are listed as being under the authority of mMAN—IGI-a-ni CTN 3 99 r. ii 16 (not dated, but cf. Dalley -Postgate [1984] 176); five team commanders are attributed to mMAN—IGI-ni in an administrative do-cument from Kalhu; the names of some officers given in the first source are repeated CTN 3 101 iii 3 (not dated). 
2′. Possibly co-author of a letter written from Babylonia to the king: mMAN—IGI.LAL-ni-ma and another Šarru-emuranni (certainly 6., the military official active in Babylonia) report on a fort in Babylonia SAA 15 220:2 (not dated). 
It is also possible that the governor of Bit-Zama-ni was transferred to Babylonia during Sargon’s campaign of 710-708 BC; an argument in favour of this identification would be that in one letter to the king (SAA 15 230) the official active in Babylonia uses the same greeting formula mentioning the well-being of the king’s pack animals and slaves as the governor of Bit-Zamani in SAA 5 47. If this identification is correct, then 5. and 6. need to be combined; the reference given above (5.c.2′.) would then refer to the governor of Mazamua (4.). 
6. High military official active in Babylonia (reign of Sargon II): Dalley -Postgate (1984) 172f suggest that Sargon sent the governor of Mazamua to Babylonia during the campaign of 710-708 BC; if this is correct, then 4. and 6. need to be combined and the evidence listed in the following section represents only a phase in the career of the gov-ernor of Mazamua. 
a. As the author of letters to the king: The letters which Šarru-emuranni writes to the king from Ba-bylonia concern a wide range of topics, from vari-ous military subjects to questions concerning the re-establishment of public order, from the handling of deportees to the quest for missing people, from liaising with the local dignitaries to religious mat-ters: mLUGAL—e-mur-an-ni starts a letter to the king with the assertation that all is well with Babylon and Borsippa; the rest is fragmentary, but Kish is mentioned SAA 15 217:2 (not dated); mLUGAL— IGI.LAL-a-ni informs the king about a Chaldean spy who had been captured in Larak; this man has been questioned concerning the head of the tribe of Bit-Zerî (i.e. Marduk-aplu-iddina); the letter also mentions that a priest from the city of U$ur-Adad is on the way to the king with the king’s share of the sacrificial meal SAA 15 218:2 (not dated); mMAN—IGI.LAL-an-ni informs the king about the whereabouts of the head of the tribe of Bit-Zerî SAA 15 219:2 (not dated); [mMAN—IGI.LAL]-ni and another Šarru-emuranni report on a fort in Babylo-nia SAA 15 220:2 (not dated); [Šarru-emuranni] informs the king that members of the Puqudu tribe are afraid of being deported from Bit-Amukani SAA 15 221 (not dated); [Šarru-emuranni] informs the king about the whereabouts of the Puqudeans, including Iannuqu, sheikh of Zamê SAA 15 222 (not dated); mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-an-ni writes to the king, who is currently staying in Babylonia, con-cerning matters of horses and missing officers SAA 15 223:2 (not dated); mMAN—IGI.LAL-an-ni reacts to the king’s invitation sent via Bel-iqiša to come and see him SAA 15 224:2 (not dated); [Šarru-emuranni] reports on a planned audience with some dignitaries from Sippar SAA 15 225 (not dated); mMAN—IGI.LAL-an-ni informs the king that a group of fifteen men from Borsippa, headed by Nabû-ereš, have been asking to meet him in Sippar; they want to have an audience with the king but have never been to the palace before — the king is to decide how to treat their request SAA 15 226:2 (not dated); of another letter of mMAN—IGI-a-ni to the king, only the beginning is preserved SAA 15 227:2 (not dated); another letter fragment men-tions the Puqudu tribe SAA 15 228 (not dated); Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) is mentioned in another fragment, as well as Nabû-ereš and his home town Borsippa SAA 15 229 (not dated); [Šarru-emuranni] details the problems in establishing Nabû-taklak’ s authority in Bit-Dak-kuri SAA 15 230 (not dated); another letter frag-ment makes mention of the tribes of Hatallu, Lu-hutu and Bit-Amukani SAA 15 231 (not dated); mLUGAL—e-[mur-an-ni] reports that the royal body-guard Ahu-bani has escorted seventy Urar#ians and their families to Sippar where they have been set-tled; however, ten persons are said to have fled SAA 15 232:2 (not dated); another fragment con-cerns the organization of deportees SAA 15 233 (not dated); mMAN—IGI.LAL-a-ni passes on a com-plaint of Sin-iddina (an official based in Ur), who claims that the Chaldeans would not let them cul-tivate their fields SAA 15 234:2 (not dated); in another fragment, excuses are made for a missed visit to report to the king SAA 15 235 (not dated); [mMAN—IGI.LAL]-an-ni informs the king about the fate of some people belonging to Barik-il: Nabû-šallim of Larak has seized them and given to Umadi, a bodyguard of the crown prince SAA 15 236:2 (not dated); m[LUGAL]—e-mur-[an-ni] in-forms the king about the whereabouts of some people belonging to Šamaš-ila’i SAA 15 237:2 (not dated); mMAN—IGI.LAL-an-ni reports about the chief cupbearer’s refusal to let a platoon of 100 Gurreans and Itu’eans enter the fortress of Sabha-nu, despite the fact that the king himself ordered this SAA 15 238:2 (not dated); another letter frag-ment of mLUGAL—IGI.[LAL-an-ni] contains little be-yond the greeting formula and the mention of Du’ani-Issar SAA 15 239:2 (not dated). 
b. Mentioned in Assyrian and Babylonian letters from the royal correspondence: 1′. In a letter of the king: Sargon is the author of a royal letter to an unknown recipient concerning military moves in Babylonia; he mentions an order to mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-an-ni to mobilize troops in Dur-Ladini, Dur-Bilihai and Larak and bring them to the king SAA 1 18:4; mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-an-ni and the recipient of the letter are then to set out together on the campaign SAA 1 18:8 (not dated). 
2′. In a letter of %ab-$il-Ešarra, governor of Assur: %ab-$il-Ešarra informs the king of the re-cent arrival of [mL]UGAL—IGI.LAL-a-ni and Šarru-nuri from Babylon SAA 1 88:7 (not dated). 
3′. In a letter of the chief cupbearer Na’di-ilu: Na’di-ilu asks the king to write a letter to mMAN— IGI.LAL-ni telling him to make sure that the people of Bit-Amukani obey Na$ib-il SAA 5 63 r. 8 (not dated). 
4′. In a letter of Bel-iddina from Babylon: Refer-ring to an earlier order of the king concerning (inventory) tablets of the temples which he was to send on via mLUGAL—a-mur-an-ni SAA 17 43:9, Bel-iddina informs the king that he inspected everything in the area between Nemed-Laguda and Šasanaku and wrote inventories which he then sent on via mLUGAL—a-mur-an-ni-im-ma SAA 17 43:15 (not dated). 
5′. In a letter of Šama’gunu from Gambulu: Šama’gunu informs the king that a certain official will carry out repair work on the damaged foundations and will eagerly enter into service with mLUGAL—IGI and Kalumu SAA 17 153:10 (not dated). 
c. Mentioned in an administrative document from Nineveh: [mMAN—IGI].LAL-an-ni [šá? KÁ. DIN]GIR.RA.KI is named in an administrative docu-ment listing precious items, possibly tribute col-lected SAA 7 57 i 11 (not dated). 
7. City lord of Qunbuna (reign of Sargon II): In a letter to the king, mLUGAL—IGI.LAL-[an-ni] first fondly recalls how the king appointed him as city lord of Qunbuna, thereby affirming his undying loyalty, before raising the issue of a dispute be-tween himself and Dadaia from the city of Arzizi SA A 5 243:2 (not dated). 
8. Individual from Kalhu (reign of Sargon II): mMAN—IGI.LAL-ni is listed among messengers and sick persons in an administrative note from Kalhu; they all seem to belong to the army ND 2629 i 7; mMAN—[IGI].LAL-ni (possibly another homony-mous individual) is listed again later in the same text ND 2629 ii 12 (not dated).

1. Sargon I, king of Assyria, son of Ikunu and father of Puzur-Aššur II (Old Asyrian Period): a. As the son of Ikunu according to the Assyrian king list: [mLUGAL—ki-in], son of Ikunu, ruled for [...] years JNES 13 212 i 31 (Khorsabad List), 213 i 30 (SDAS List).

2. Sargon II, king of Assyria (721-705): For further details see the following references: Olm-stead (1923) 206-282; Labat (1967b) 59-68; Gray-son (1991b) 86-102; Kuhrt (1995) 497-499; Mayer (1995) 316-341. 
I. The name and its implications: The attestation of an official named LUGAL—ki-nu in the reign of Assurbanipal (see below, 3.) is clear evidence that the name per se was not a throne name restricted to ruling kings. Nor is there any proof for (or against) the assumption that the king for whatever reason changed his name after his accession (Mayer [1995] 318f). Therefore it remains unknown whether Sargon chose his name deliberately in allusion to his namesake, the great conqueror and founder of the Akkadian empire. In fact, this is rather unlikely given the fact that his inscriptions never refer to the Akkadian Sargon directly. 
Most often the name is written in logograms, however, in the rare cases when the second part of the name is written in syllables, two solutions are provided: 1. In by far the majority of cases the name is understood as a sentence: a. In inscriptions: mMAN—ú-ki-in Weidner (1933-34) 79; LUGAL—ú-kin KAH 1 38:2; LUGAL—ú-kin RIMB 2 6.22.3 i 26; dLUGAL—ú-kin RIMB 2 6.22.4 i1//6:4. 
b. In letters: mLUGAL—ú-kín SAA 13 134:10; LUGAL—ú-kin SAA 17 22:2; LUGAL—ú-kin SAA 17 39+:1; [LUGAL]—ú-kin SAA 17 46:1; [LUGAL]—ú-kin SAA 17 88:2. 
This must have been Sargon’s original name, because it was used in letters sent to him by his own subjects, who would certainly have addressed their master in the most correct way. Originally, the king referred to was most probably the mon-arch who was ruling at the time of Sargon’s birth, perhaps Aššur-dan III (see Fuchs [2009] 52f). After Sargon’s successful coup d’état, however, the “king” might have been identified as Sargon him-self, in order to legitimize his accession. This ac-corded with the idea that mMAN—GI.[NA] (Najafaha-bad i 18 = Levine [1972] 34), like most other kings, was named (i.e. chosen) by the gods. The reading Šarru-kin/ken is attested for Sargon I but not for Sargon II. 
2. The second solution, attested only once in Sargon’s palace at Khorsabad: [mLUGAL—ke]-e-nu (Fuchs [1994] 3S:1 [var.]) means “The righ-teous/true king”. In striking contrast to its rare attestation, the royal epithets following the king’s name in his various inscriptions almost exclusively refer to this second interpretation. But most often the king’s righteousness was emphasized and his name was translated accordingly. So, for instance, when the logographically written mLUGAL—GI.NA was immediately followed by the epithet NUN ke-e-nu i.e. “righteous/true prince” (Fuchs [1998] VIIb:33), or when the name mLUGAL—GI.NA reap-pears partially translated two lines later as LUGAL ki-i-nu TCL 3:112. The epithet [LUG]AL ki-[i-nu] is used also in a land grant SAA 12 19:55′. The earliest reference may be found in the so-called Assur Charter, if the damaged passage m[LUGAL— GI].NA MAN x iá x is to be understood accordingly (Iraq 37 12 r. 34). Slightly less obvious but similar is the frequent use of the title re’û kenu “righ-teous/true shepherd,” cf. Iraq 37 12:13, Fuchs (1994) Zyl. 3, Winckler (1889) II 48:2, Fuchs (1994) 45.1:4, Iraq 56 36f:3, Najafehabad i 22 = Levine (1972) 34, 66, and Fuchs (1994) Stier 3. Only a king who had won his throne by usurpation was in need of such epithets. Especially useful for emphasizing one’s own righteousness was to com-pare the “true king” with contemporaries whose rule or rise to power was described as outrageously evil. Not surprisingly, Sargon’s deposed predeces-sor was the first whose memory was “honoured” in such a way: because Shalmaneser V did not revere the gods and imposed hardship upon the Assyrians, the god Aššur replaced him with m[LUGAL—GI].NA, who instantly restored the freedom of the citizens and the privileges of the temples Iraq 37 12 r. 34. Later on, foreign enemies and rebels are used for comparison: Rusâ violated the oath sworn in the name of Aššur (cf. TCL 3 148), whereas mLUGAL— GI.NA is the protector of justice and a humble worshipper of the gods TCL 3 156. In contrast to Iamani, who owed his throne to the rebellious rabble of Ashdod, mLUGAL—GI.NA is the righteous prince, who keeps his oath Fuchs (1998) VIIb:33. Against the evil Marduk-apla-iddina (Merodach-baladan), who ruled against the will of the gods, Marduk chose humble mLUGAL—GI.NA to throw him out Fuchs (1994) Ann. 261. But the name was to be understood as a program too. For instance, when Sargon obtained the land necessary to build his new capital Dur-Šarrukin, he compensated the landowners for their losses “in accordance with the name the great gods have given me to maintain justice and right” (Fuchs [1994] Zyl. 50). The king’s scribes even discovered a cryptic message in Sargon’s name: the signs used to write the name could be read as a numeral corresponding exactly to the circumference (measured in cubits) of the newly built city of Dur-Šarrukin (cf. Fuchs [1994] 294 n.88). 
But sometimes even the righteous becomes the victim of malicious slander and ingratitude: Pisiri, king of Carchemish, spread evil gossip against [m][LUGAL—GI.NA] Fuchs (1998) IIb:4; Mannean governors believed the lies of the Urar#ian king and became enemies of mLUGAL—GI.NA Fuchs (1994) Ann.80; and even his own son-in-law Ambaris forgot the favours mLUGAL—GI.NA had shown to him Fuchs (1994) Zyl.23. In the mundane world driven by human vacillation, mishaps as such may happen. But the gods are different. Their judg-ment is fair. Therefore humble, true and righteous mLUGAL—GI.NA had every reason to expect a long and happy life ever after, to be spent in the (not quite so humble) abode of Dur-Šarrukin, amassing the treasures of the whole world Fuchs [1994] XIV .77; for a probably similar but badly preserved passage see [m][LUGAL—GI.NA] Prism D viii 12 = Iraq 16 pl. XLIX; cf. Fuchs (1994) Ann.456-463. 
II. Family background: mMAN—ú-ki-in was a son of Tiglath-pileser III (Weidner [1933-34] 79; for additional evidence see Thomas [1993] 465-470). 
His mother may well have been Tiglath-pileser’s wife Iabâ. 
Two brothers of Sargon are known: First, there was Shalmaneser V, his predecessor, whom he deposed in 722. In striking contrast Sargon had complete confidence in his second brother, Sin-ahu-u$ur, who (in 714) was in command of the royal cavalry guard (TCL 3 132). In Dur-Šarrukin, Sin-ahu-usur had a palace of his own. He acted as grand vizier (LÚ.SUKKAL.MAH) and was called the favorite brother (talimu) of mMAN—GIN Fuchs (1994) 285, L.1. The gods, who blessed mMAN— GIN, spoke in favor of Sin-ahu-u$ur as well Fuchs (1994) 285, L.6. 
Atalia was a (or the) wife (MUNUS.É.GAL) of mMAN—GIN (Kamil [1999] 16 no. 5:1 // 6:1 // 7:2; cf. Dalley [1998] 83-98). Atalia was buried in Kalhu, so she may have died before the new palace of Dur-Šarrukin was finished. 
Beginning in 710 at the latest (for the dating see Fuchs [forthcoming] 1.7 and 5.), Sargon received reports sent by Sennacherib, his famous son and crown prince, who must by then have come of age. Perhaps in order to avoid the risk of losing both king and crown prince at the same time, Sennach-erib stayed behind when his father led his cam-paigns. Apart from various domestic matters he mentioned in his reports, Sennacherib paid careful attention to what was going on in the regions just to the north of Assyria proper, in Ukku, Kumme and Urar#u. Perhaps he was in charge of the secret operations and spying activities in this area (Frahm [1997] 2f). During Sargon’ s lifetime, Sennacherib married Naqi’a/Zakutu (Melville [1999] 13), who thereby became the daughter-in-law of mMAN—GI. NA ADD 645:3 = RINAP 4 2005; mLUGAL—GIN ADD 645 r. 3 = RINAP 4 2006; see Melville (1999) 43, 99f. As king, Sennacherib never mentioned his father in his own official records. In this he fol-lowed Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II, both of whom had not mentioned their respective prede-cessors either. 
The “son of Sargon” (DUMU mLUGAL—GIN) who is mentioned in a badly preserved letter might have been either Sennacherib or another son (see SAA 17 94 r. 18). 
A daughter of Sargon is known, because the king made use of her in order to strengthen his ties with the important region of Tabal. She was given in marriage to Ambaris, the son and successor of Hullî, king of Tabal (Fuchs [1994] Ann.198, Prunk.29-30). A letter sent by the crown prince Sennacherib mentions a lady Ahat-abiša whose major-domo had sent a letter from Tabal; for this reason Ahat-abiša is identified as the daughter of Sargon who was married to Ambaris (SAA 1 31 r. 27) although this identification is doubtful (Fuchs [forthcoming] 5.). The arrangement did not meet with success. Ambaris plotted against his father-in-law and was deposed in 713; the fate of his wife is unknown. 
III. Political History: 1. Phases: a. The accession (722-721). In 722/21, on the 12th day of month Kanun/Tebet (Dec-Jan), Sargon ascended the throne in Assyria, after Shalmaneser V had died in the same month (Grayson [1975] 73:29-31). The succession had been violent and the newly-won power had to be secured. Subsequently 6,300 Assyrian “sinners” (i.e. members of the op-position) were pardoned but were nevertheless re-garded as unreliable and therefore deported to Ha-math in Syria (Hawkins [2004] 160 side B 4-12); the number of those who were killed is unknown. Not surprisingly, political decisions of Shal-maneser were changed or revoked. Hullî, the for-mer king of Tabal who had been deported by Shal-maneser V, was now reinstalled. Other revocations may have involved the resumption of the trade with Egypt and the replacement of Gunzinanu by Tarhu-nazi at the head of the vassal-state of Kammanu. During his entire first year Sargon was busy secur-ing his throne; no military endeavours of any im-portance can be allocated to this phase. Sargon was not even able to respond when Babylonia was lost to Merodach-baladan. 
b. 720-717: A new phase began with Sargon’s battle against an invading Elamite army near Der (720). The outcome was not entirely convincing but this battle was celebrated as Sargon’s first great victory, comparable only to that at Mount Wauš (714) and the reconquest of Babylonia (710-709). In the same year, 720, an Assyrian army subdued a rebellion in Syria and even routed an Egyptian army. During this stage no plan or program is discernible. Rather, Sargon responded to various challenges in different areas as and when they arose: in Mannea (719), Šinuhtu (718), Karkemiš (717) and Mannea again (717). 
c. 716-713: Sargon now faced three main adver-saries: Mitâ, the king of Muški/Phrygia far in the west; Rusâ, king of Urar#u, who made trouble among the Hittite states as well as in western Iran; and last but not least, there was Merodach-baladan, king of Bit-Iakin, who was now in possession of Babylon and allied with the king of Elam. In 717/ 716 Rusâ delivered a heavy blow against Sargon’s Mannean ally and threatened A ssyria’ s positions in western Iran. Again, Sargon was forced to react, but it is clear that he then made a calculated deci-sion to focus his activities entirely on this enemy for the next four years. Sargon regained control over Mannea (716), strengthened it as a buffer against Urar#u (715) and defeated Rusâ in a pitched battle at Mount Wauš (714). This victory was the second peak of his reign and it marked the end of the long war between Assyria and Urar#u. At the same time Sargon established new provinces in western Iran (716), won control over an increasing number of Median chiefdoms (716, 715, 713) and intervened in the vassal state of Ellipi (713). Most of these campaigns were led by the king person-ally. In comparison, the trouble caused by Mitâ of Muški in Que and Tabal was considered of second-ary importance. Two campaigns in these areas were left to local governors (715, 713). 
d. 712-709: With Urar#u defeated and western Iran secured, Sargon was ready for the reconquest of Babylonia. In 712 there was no campaign at all (Fuchs [1998] 85-87). Perhaps some respite was needed to prepare the war against Merodach-bala-dan. First, however, Sargon’s attention was diverted to the northeast, to Tabal, Marqasi and Kammanu, where the deteriorating situation de-manded intervention in order to stabilize this fron-tier (711). The reconquest of Babylon (710) was less troublesome than expected because Mero-dach-baladan’ s kingdom collapsed immediately. Only in Bit-Iakin did the Assyrians meet with stubborn resistance. The siege of Dur-Iakin, Mero-dach-baladan’s well fortified capital, began in 709 and resulted in stalemate: Merodach-baladan sur-rendered the fortress but retreated with his follo-wers to Elam. At the same time, far away in the northwest, Mitâ of Muški/Phrygia sued for peace (709) after a successfull Assyrian raid against his territory (710). 
e. 708-706: Sargon was now at the zenith of his power. Since 710 he had been not only king of Assyria but king of Babylon as well, and his three main adversaries, Rusâ, Merodach-baladan and Mitâ were either dead or neutralized. The remain-ing troublespots were of minor or local importance only, the operations against Kummuhi (708), Ellipi (707) and Karalla (706) were delegated to govern-ors and their troops. Meanwhile the king received embassies from distant parts of the world, such as Iadnana/Cyprus (708) and Dilmun (710?/706). Even the Kushite kings, who now ruled in Egypt, tried to establish good relations with Assyria (Fuchs [1998] 124-131). In 707 the king returned to Assyria, where his new capital was about to be completed. The invitation of the gods to the new city as well as the inauguration of Dur-Šarrukin (707) were used to celebrate Sargon as the king of the world. 
f. 705: In 705 Sargon campaigned once more in Tabal personally, where he died under unclear cir-cumstances. His son Sennacherib ascended the throne on 12th Abu (Jul-Aug) 705 (Millard [1994] 48; Frahm [1997] 8f; Frahm [1999] 73-90). 
2. Regions: a. South: Babylonia had been conquered by Ti-glath-pileser III and held by Shalmaneser V. Only three months after Sargon’s coup d’état, in Nisan-nu (i.) 721, Merodach-baladan, the powerful king of Bit-Iakin, who took advantage of the turmoil in Assyria was in possession of southern Mesopota-mia and became king of Babylon. Strengthened by his alliance with the Elamite king and various tribes in Babylonia, Merodach-baladan was able to hold his position for no less than twelve years (Grayson [1975] 73:32; Fuchs [1994] Ann.255-260, Prunk.121-124). His Assyrian adversary was fully occupied with countless problems and first there was no response at all. In 720 Sargon defended Der against an attack from Merodach-ba-ladan’s Elamite ally, but the outcome of the pitched battle did not change the situation. (Saggs [1975] 14:16-17; Grayson [1975] 73:33-37; Fuchs [1994] Ann.18-20) For years a war of rather low intensity dragged on along the Babylonian border as both Sargon and Merodach-baladan lacked the means to bring it to an end. Probably in 720 two tribes at the Babylo-
nian border, the Tesa and the Tu’muna, were pun-ished by Sargon for their disloyalty. In 712 Mero-dach-baladan attacked a Chaldaean tribe perhaps for similar reasons (Grayson [1975] 75:41-44; Fuchs [1994] Zyl.18, Ann.20-21). 
In 710 Sargon was ready for a major war against Merodach-baladan. The Assyrian army first sub-dued the Aramean tribes east of the Tigris and cut off Elam from the theatre of war in Babylonia. When Merodach-baladan retreated to Bit-Iakin, Babylon itself surrendered to the Assyrians. In 709, after Sargon’s first New Year’s festival in Babylon, Merodach-baladan was attacked in his kingdom of Bit-Iakin. Heavily besieged in his capi-tal Dur-Iakin, he finally gave up and retreated to Elam (Grayson [1975] 75:1′-2′; Fuchs [1994] Ann. 260-383, Prunk.124-143 and pp. 399-405; Gadd [1954] 185f vi 14-83, 191 vii 7-19; VS 1 71:1-22; Fuchs apud Fuchs -Parpola [2001] XIII-XXII). 
As soon as Assyria was in control of southern Mesopotamia, successive kings of Dilmun, first Uperi and later (706) Ahundara, established friend-ly relations with the conqueror (Fuchs [1994] Ann. 383-384, Prunk.144-145; Gadd [1954] 191 vi 20-24; VS 1 71:23-27; Frame [1999] 40:27). 
Until 707 Sargon stayed in the south, but due to lack of time most of his plans to improve the situation in Babylonia probably never materialized (Grayson [1975] 75:3′; Millard [1994] 48; Gadd [1954] 191 vii 7-19, 192 vii 45-77; cf. Brinkman [1984] 48-54 and Fuchs [1994] 382). 
b. East: In western Iran Sargon inherited an age-old contest against Urar#u for the control of the lands to the southeast of lake Urmia. In 719 as well as in 717 Sargon assisted his most important ally, king Iranzi of Mannea, to recapture Mannean bor-der settlements conquered by the Urar#ian king Rusâ and his ally Mitatti, the king of Zikirtu. For 719 see Najafehabad ii 13-16 = Levine (1972) 34f; Fuchs (1994) Ann.58-68; Prunk.48; Prunk.57. For 717 see Fuchs (1994) Ann.76-78; Prunk.57. 
The situation changed dramatically when Iranzi died and his successor Azâ was killed in battle by the Urar#ian coalition. Rusâ now installed his own candidate Ullusunu on the Mannean throne and thereby succeeded in toppling the Assyrian posi-tion. At the same time there was trouble concerning the Assyrian vassals around Parsua and the Median border. In the coming years Sargon focussed on western Iran in order to resolve both problems. In 716 an Assyrian invasion convinced the Mannean king Ullusunu to switch sides and to become Sar-gon’s vassal. Now Mannea was part of the Assy-rian coalition again. Sargon also regained control of Mannea’ s southern neighbours, the renegade vassal states of Allabria and Karalla. No less im-portant was the establishment of two new provin-cial capitals in Kišesim and Harhar in order to extend Assyria’s power in Media. Harhar in par-ticular, now renamed Kar-Šarrukin, soon de-veloped into the most important Assyrian stron-ghold in western Iran. Finally an Assyrian advance into Media brought about the submission of dozens of Median city lords. See Najafehabad ii 22-71 = Levine (1972) 34f; Fuchs (1998) II.d, III.b-c; Fuchs [1994] Ann.78-100, Prunk.36-41, Prunk.50-51, Prunk.55-56, Prunk.58-67. 
In 715 the Assyrian army was active in both areas once more. In order to stabilize Mannea, the borders of its hostile neigbours Urar#u and Andia were devastated and the Assyrians helped to arrest the disloyal Mannean governor Daiukku. Further-more, a rebellion had to be quelled in the new province of Harhar/Kar-Šarrukin. See Fuchs (1998) III.e:12-23. Fuchs (1994) Ann.101-117, Prunk.44-45, Prunk.49; see Prunk.52-53 for Daiukku. 
714 was the year of Sargon’s famous eighth campaign. The Assyrian invasion of Zikirtu was but the continuation of the scheme to weaken Man-nea’s evil neighbours. Then, however, the Assy-rians advanced and routed the Urar#ian king Rusâ and his allies in a pitched battle at Mount Wauš. Sargon now made full use of his victory and wrought havoc in several Urar#ian provinces. The last stage of the campaign was the sack of Mu$a$ir, a rich and important cultic centre connected with the Urar#ian empire. Sargon’s victory in 714 marked the end of the contest between Assyria and Urar#u in western Iran as neither side ever resumed this war. Urar#u had to fend off Cimmerian incur-sions whereas Assyria was interested more in the regions south of Mannea. See Thureau-Dangin (1912) and Mayer (1984); Fuchs (1998) Annalen IV .a-f, V .a.1-6; Fuchs (1994) Ann.127-164, Prunk.42-43, Prunk.45-47, Prunk.54, Prunk.72-76; Gadd (1954) 177 iii 1-41; VS 1 71 r. 39-50. Lanfranchi (1990) 11-42; Ivantchik (1993) 19-55. 
In 713 Sargon again campaigned on behalf of his Zagros provinces. The submission of Karalla, Šurda and Habhu re-opened lines of communica-tion. The intervention in favour of Daltâ the king of Ellipi, who faced a serious rebellion, stabilized another important vassal of Assyria. This was fol-lowed by one of the deepest raids into Media ever accomplished by an Assyrian army. See Fuchs (1994) Zyl.27, Zyl.32-33, Ann.164-194, Prunk.67-72, Prunk.76-78; Fuchs (1998) V .a:7-11, V .b-d, VI.a-b, VI.c:1; Gadd (1954) 177 iii 42-56. 
A new crisis emerged, when the unstable king-dom of Ellipi was shaken by a war of succession after king Daltâ died. In 707 an Assyrian army ousted Nibê together with his Elamite auxiliaries and installed Ašpabara instead. See Fuchs (1994) Ann.412-424, Prunk.117-121; Fuchs apud Fuchs -Parpola (2001) XXIX-XXXI. 
In 706 Karalla had to be subdued once again, for the third time (Millard [1994] 48; Frame [1999] 41:37-44.) c. Northwest: Within the large area between the Halys and the Euphrates Sargon competed with two powerful rivals, the kings of Urar#u as well as Mitâ of Mušku, for the control of the so-called Neo-Hittite kingdoms. Time and again Assyrian vassals were lured away into his enemies’ sphere of influence while the more powerful Hittite kings tried to take advantage of the great powers’ rival-ries. They saw themselves not as subjects or vas-sals but as equal players in a power game where they could switch sides freely. As those kingdoms were easy to conquer but difficult to protect, con-
quest was only a last resort when all else had failed, but in the end all of Sargon’s numerous attempts to strengthen his ties with those unruly rulers failed completely. So it was in his reign that most of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms one by one fell prey to the Assyrian empire. 
In 718 Kiakki of Šinuhtu, who stopped paying his tribute, was deported and his city was given to Kurtî of Atuna. See Najafehabad ii 17-19 = Levine (1972) 34f; Fuchs (1994) Zyl.22, Ann.68-71, Prunk.28-29; Gadd (1954) 180 iv 50-54. 
In 717 Sargon suspected Pisiri(s) of being a traitor and annexed his city Karkemiš. See Najafe-habad ii 20-22 = Levine (1972) 34f; Fuchs (1998) II.b/c:1-14; Fuchs (1994) Ann.72-76; Gadd (1954) 179 iv 13-24. 
In 715 a number of fortresses in Que which had previously been occupied by Mitâ of Mušku were reconquered. At the same time Que was threatened by Ionian pirates. See Fuchs (1994) Zyl.21, Ann.117-120, Ann.125-126; Gadd (1954) 182 v 34-40. 
Shortly afterwards, two important kings, Kurti of Atuna and Am(ba)ris of Tabal/Bit-Purutaš, left the Assyrian side and formed alliances with Mušku and Urar#u. Sargon had bestowed favours on both of them, he had installed Hullî, Am(ba)ris’ father, on the throne of Tabal, and Am(ba)ris himself had even married Sargon’ s daughter (Ahat-abiša), but all Assyrian attempts to strengthen ties with those kings failed. In 713 Sargon sent several Assyrian governors with their troops, who removed Am(ba)ris and turned Tabal into an Assyrian pro-vince. See Fuchs (1998) Annalen VI.c:2-11, VI.d-e, VII.a:1-4; Fuchs (1994) Ann.194-204, Prunk. 29-32; Gadd (1954) 182 v 13-33. Kurtî now hur-ried to submit once more and was reconciled with Sargon (Fuchs [1998] Annalen VII.a:5-12). 
The year 712, however, brought about serious losses when Mitâ of Mušku invaded the new pro-vince of Tabal and threw the Assyrians out again (Fuchs [1994] 462f). He also succeeded in winning over Tarhun-azi of Kammanu/Meliddu, another king who owed his throne to Sargon. About the same time Tarhu-lara of Gurgum was murdered by his own son Mutallu. In 711 Sargon answered with a full-scale attack led by himself and captured both Mutallu and Tarhun-azi. Gurgum now ended up as an Assyrian province. The eastern part of Kamma-nu with the city of Meliddu was given to Mutallu of Kummuh as a reward for his loyalty. So there was no attempt to recover Tabal, but the city of Til-Garimmu was turned into an Assyrian fortress in order to defend the Assyrian sphere of influence against the enemies from Urar#u, Kašku and Mušku. See Fuchs (1998) VII.c-e, VIII.b, also pp. 85-88. Fuchs (1994) Ann.204-241, Prunk.78-89. Gadd (1954) 182f v 41-75. 
In 710, when Sargon was busy with his cam-paigns in Babylonia, the governor of Que carried on the war against Mitâ of Mušku and raided his territory with great success (Fuchs [1994] Ann.385-389, Prunk.149-151). 
In the following year, 709, Sargon’s quarrel with Mitâ came to an end when the latter sued for peace (Fuchs [1994] Ann.389-393, Prunk.152-153). 
When Mutallu of Kummuhu switched sides and allied himself with the Urar#ian king Argišti (II), this was the end of the last important neo-Hittite kingdom. In 708 Mutallu fled before the advancing Assyrians, who annexed his territory. The city of Kummuhu now became a cornerstone of the Assy-rian presence in the Northwest. See Fuchs (1994) Ann.398-411, Prunk.112-117; Gadd (1954) 179 iv 1-12. 
In 705, on his last campaign, Sargon lost his life in Tabal, fighting against “Gurdî the Kulummean,” who might be identical with Sargon’s former vas-sal or ally Kurtî of Atunna. See Grayson (1975) 76:6′; Millard (1994) 48; for Gurdî see Fuchs (1994) 411f and Aro (1998) 142f. 
d. Southwest: When Sargon ascended the throne, no enemy of importance was left within Syria and the southern Levant. However, the petty kingdoms bordering on the Assyrian provinces had their own will and they had good reason to hope for support from Egyptian rulers worried by the powerful As-syrian presence in their neighbourhood. 
Sources written later in his reign credit Sargon with the conquest of Samaria in 722, but most probably this was an achievement of Shalmaneser V. See Fuchs (1994) Ann.10-17, Prunk.23-25; Gadd (1954) 179 iv 25-45 and Tadmor (1958) 34; cf. Fuchs (1998) 84f. 
In 722, his accession year, Sargon probably can-celled an administrative measure of Shalmaneser V when he reopened the sealed emporium of Egypt and encouraged trade. See Fuchs (1994) Ann.17-18; Gadd (1954) 179 iv 46-49. 
Soon afterwards Syria witnessed the last great uprising against Assyrian rule. The land of Hamat-tu, ruled by a man called Iau-bi’di/Ilu-bi’di, was the centre of the rebellion, but Arpad, \imirra, Damascus, Samaria and possibly Judah were also involved. Further to the south Hanunu of Hazutu (Gaza), an Assyrian vassal since the time of Ti-glath-pileser III, allied himself with an Egyptian ruler. In 720 Assyrian troops sent by Sargon de-feated the Syrian rebels at Qarqar, routed an Egy-tian army led by the general Re’e at Rapihu (Ra-phia) and captured Hanunu. See Saggs (1975) 14:17-27; Frame (2006) 52; Najafehabad ii 4-13 = Levine (1972) 34f; Winckler (1889) II 48:8 with Na’aman (1994a) 17-20 and Na’aman (1994b) 235; Hawkins (2004) 160 side B 1-12; Fuchs (1994) Ann.23-25, Ann.53-57, Prunk.25-26, Prunk.33-36; VS 1 71 r. 51-65. 
Afterwards, apart from minor disturbances in 715, when some Arab tribes were forced to settle in Samaria, the interior of Syria remained quiet (Fuchs [1994] Ann.120-123). 
On the sea coast Sargon cooperated with the city of Tyre. In 715 Ionian pirates who raided Tyre and Que were defeated in a sea battle (Fuchs [1994] Zyl.21, Ann.117-119; cf. Lanfranchi [2000] 14ff). 
In 708 Sargon provided Sil#a, the ruler of Tyre, with troops for the reconquest of Cyprus. When they arrived, the rebellious seven kings of Ia’/Iad-nana (Cyprus) submitted at once to Sargon, who had a stele erected near modern Larnaka. See Fuchs (1994) Ann.393-398, Prunk.145-149 with improvements by Na’aman (1998) 239ff; Gadd (1954) 191f vi 25-44; VS 1 71:28-57. 
In the southernmost Levant, after the clash at Raphia in 720 no further wars against Egyptian rulers are recorded. From 716 or so Sargon was on good terms with at least one of the rulers in the Delta. In that year, when some deportees were settled at the border to Egypt, Šilkannu (Usilkanu, Osorkon V), the king of Egypt, for the first time sent presents or tribute. See Fuchs (1998) III.e.1-11. 
In 715 things went even better when Sargon received gifts or tribute not only from “Pharaoh” (Pir’û) but also from the Arab queen Samsi and the Sabean It’amar (Fuchs [1994] Ann.123-125, Prunk.27). 
The only troublespot was the city of Ashdod. Some time before 711 Sargon deposed its king Azuri after an attempt to form an alliance against Assyria and replaced him with Ahi-Miti. This pup-pet ruler was killed by his subjects and Iamani (or Iadna), the rebel leader of Ashdod, made new ef-forts to win over not only the neighbouring rulers but also “Pharaoh” himself. But the alliance never came into being and in 711 Sargon captured the politically isolated city of Ashdod in a short and swift campaign. See Fuchs (1998) VII.a.13-14, VII.b with pp. 124ff; Fuchs (1994) Ann.241-254, Prunk.90-109. 
Iamani found refuge in Egypt. Between 711 and 707, however, the Delta was conquered by the Kushites who were interested in good relations with their Assyrian neighbour. So in 707 Šapataku’ (Šebitko), the king “of Meluhha” (i.e. of the Ku-shite empire), extradited Iamani as an act of good-will. See Fuchs (1994) XIV .11-14, Prunk.109-112; Frame (1999) 36:20; Weidner (1941-44) 50:1-11; Castellino (1975) 71:4 with Na’aman (1999); cf. Fuchs (1998) 124-131. 
IV. Building projects:
1. In Assyria and the Assyrian provinces:
a. Dur-Šarrukin was founded in 717. On 22 Tašritu (vii.) 707 the gods entered their temples, and on 6 Ajjaru (ii.) 706 Dur-Šarrukin was com-pleted (Millard [1994] 46-48).

V. Monuments: 1. The stele found at Acharneh (720) belonged to a group of at least five stelae set up in Hamat, Hatarikka and other places in Syria (Frame [2006] 49-52). 
2. In 716 two stelae were made in Western Iran, one (not recovered) at Harhar (Fuchs [1994] Ann. 99, Prunk.63; Gadd [1954] 176 ii (in E) 13-17), the other at Kišesim (Fuchs [1998] III.b,17-21; Fuchs [1994] Ann.95, Prunk.60). Most probably the Kišesim stele is identical with the one found near Najafehabad (Levine [1972] 25ff). 
3. In 715 a stele was set up in the Mannean royal city of Izirtu (not recovered; see Fuchs [1994] Ann.108-109). 
4. In 707 at least three stelae were set up in the West: Of these the stele from Ashdod (only frag-ments left, Dothan [1971] Pl.96-97) and the Bo-rowski-stele (Hawkins [2004] 151-164) may have belonged to the same group. The famous stele found at Larnaka/Cyprus (VS 1 71) is mentioned in the Nimrud prisms (Gadd [1954] 192 vii 39-44). 
5. In 706 Sargon’s generals left a rock-inscrip-tion near Tang-i var in western Iran (Frame [1999] 31-57). 
6. The fragments published by Woolley -Bar-nett (1952) Pl.A 33m and Gadd apud Crowfoot et al. (1957) 35, pl.IV may be the remnants of two further stelae from Sargon’s reign. 
VI. Attestations of Sargon’s name:
1. In place names:
a. In 717 Sargon founded his famous new city at the place of the town of Maganuba (Fuchs [1994] Zyl.44) and named it “Dur-Šarru-ukin” (see Fuchs [1994] 431 for references). 
b. In 716 the city of Harhar in Western Iran became the centre of a new province and soon after it was renamed “Kar-Šarru-ukin”. The earliest source, the stele from Najafehabad, written in the course of the campaign, does not mention the new name (Levine [1972] 25ff). The renaming is men-tioned in inscriptions written after 711 (Fuchs [1998] III.c,1; Fuchs [1994] Ann.100, Prunk.63; Gadd [1954] 176 ii [in E] 7). The new name did not survive the end of Sargon’s reign. As early as 702, Sennacherib imitated his father by changing the name of the city of Elenzaš into “Kar-Sin-ahhe-eriba,” but he put the city in charge of the governor of Harhar (Luckenbill [1924] 28f ii 27-32; see Frahm [1999] 10). 
2. In Sargon’s own inscriptions and other texts from his reign: a. Inscriptions: Of Sargon’s many titles, two are typical for specific periods of his reign: 1′. Before 712, Sargon is “the (chosen) priest (nešakku) or ruler (iššakku) of Aššur”: mLUGAL— GI.NA Iraq 37 12:12; mMAN—GI.NA Najafehabad i 19 = Levine (1972) 34, 66; mLUGAL—GI.NA Winckler (1889) II 48:1; mLUGAL—GI.NA Fuchs (1994) Zyl.1; [mLUGAL]-GI.NA Fuchs (1994) Bro.1; mLUGAL-GI.NA Fuchs (1994) Si.1; mLUGAL-GI.NA Fuchs (1994) Go. 1; mLUGAL]-GIN Fuchs (1994) Ant.1; mMAN—GIN Fuchs (1994) Ziegel a.1; [mLUGAL—GI.NA] Iraq 56 36f:1; mLUGAL—GI.NA 1 R 6,7:1; mLUGAL—GI.NA 3 R 3,12:1. Similarly, in the letter to the god Aššur mLUGAL—GI.NA is the pure priest (sangû) of Aššur TCL 3:5. 
2′.

Title(s) lost: mMAN—[GIN] Thompson -Hutchin-son (1929) 28:1; mMAN—GIN Thompson -Hutchin-son (1929) 41:1 // 71:1. 
b. In administrative records: In a sealing: state service remitted by m[MAN]— GI.NA to a provincial governor SAA 11 49:1. mLUGAL—GI.NA is mentioned in a record of food offerings SAA 7 170:3; m[LUGAL—GI.NA] renews a land grant of Adad-nerari to provide offerings for Aššur SAA 12 19 r. 18. According to a collection of decrees written later, mMAN—GIN had established offerings by the rab qaqqulati and the chief cook which were destined for the regular offerings SAA 12 77 i 27; mMAN—GIN had established additional offerings by the rab qaqqulati for libations and the hariu ritual SAA 12 77 r. iii 17. 
c. In date formulae: 1′. As eponym for the year 719: In versions of the Eponym List: [mLUGA]L—GI.NA // mMAN—GIN [MAN] // mMAN—GIN MAN // [mMAN—GI]N MAN // [mLUGAL—GI.N]A MAN? KUR—[aš-šur.KI] Eponym List719(A1v4,A3iii4′,A5ii3,A7viii34,A9 i 1). The relevant entry in the Eponym Chronicle is not preserved. In the date formula of documents: mMAN—GIN ND 2374 r. 4; CTN 2 261:1; SAA 11 65:4. 
2′. In dates counted by regnal years: a′′. As king of Assyria in “double datings”: The eponymy of Aššur-bani (713) corresponds to the 9th year of mMAN—GIN SAA 12 19 r. 28. The epo-nymy of Issar-duri (714, year 8) is erroneously connected with year 9 of mLUGAL—GI.NA MAN KUR— da-šur Iraq 14 23 r. 23. The eponymy of Mannu-ki-Aššur-le’i (709, year 13) is erroneously assigned to year 12 of mLUGAL—GI.NA SAA 6 31 r. 29. 
b′′. As king of Babylon: The Eponym Chronicle records that in 709, his accession year as king of Babylon, mMAN—GI.NA took the hands of Bel Epo-nym Chronicle 709. An astronomical report is dated to the first year of LUGAL—GI.NA LUGAL TIN. TIR.KI SAA 8 501 r. 2 (709). Sargon’s 15th year as king of Assyria (707) corresponds to his 3rd year as king of Babylon (Fuchs [1994] 196 Prunk.23, 232 Prunk.144). The king presented gifts to the Babylonian gods “from the outset of my reign up to my 4th year” (706) (Gadd [1954] 191:19). 
d. In the titulary of Sargon’s officials: In an inscription on an axe-head (excavated at Tell Had-dad) made out of lapis lazuli, a [governor?] (name not preserved) of Na’iri presents himself as a eu-nuch of mMAN—GIN MAN KUR—aš al-Rawi (1994) 35ff, no. 2. Nabû-kabti-ahhešu was a palace scribe of mLUGAL—GI.NA SAA 6 31 r. 4 (709). Nabû-šal-limšunu was chief royal scribe, LÚ.GAL—NAM? and master scholar of mLUGAL—GI.NA TCL 3 428. Nabû-u$alla, governor of Tamnuna, was a eunuch of mMAN—GI.NA king of Assyria NABU 1991/86:1. Pan-Aššur-lamur was a eunuch of srgn Orient (1993) 116 no.6.7:3. 
e. In letters: In 710 or thereafter, Abi-iaqia re-ports to LUGAL—GI.NA on the flight of the Aramean sheikh Natannu to Elam SAA 17 149:2, 3 (not dated). The inhabitants of Nemed-Laguda send a letter to [LUGAL—GI.N]A // mLUGAL—GIN concerning the situation following the conquest of the Sealand SAA 17 145:5, 13 (not dated). Remutu writes from Babylon to LUGAL—GI.NA about cultic affairs in Esagil SAA 17 47:2 (not dated). Bel-iqiša urges LUGAL—ú-kin to send help against Merodach-bala-dan SAA 17 22:2. In another letter from [Bel-iqiša], LUGAL—GIN is mentioned in a broken pas-sage SAA 17 27:13. Qišti-Marduk writes to LUGAL—ú-kin in order to defend his prelacy SAA 17 39:2. Nabû-[šuma-iškun] sends a letter to [LUGAL]—ú-kin complaining about his enemy SAA 17 46:1. [Ar]ad-Ea reports to [LUGAL]—GIN on Ba-bylonian affairs SAA 17 51:2, 4. The commanders of the fortress of Šabhanu report to LUGAL—GIN // [LU]GAL—GIN on intrigues against the prefect of Bit-Dakkuri SAA 17 59:1. The contents of another letter sent by these commanders to LUGAL—GIN is not preserved SAA 17 60:1. Daini and Nabû-le’i sent a letter to [LUGAL]—ú-kin (contents not preserved) SAA 17 88:2. In broken context [LU]GAL—GIN is mentioned together with Sin-duri and Sin-ibni SAA 17 42:6. Sargon may be restored as the recipient of a number of other Babylonian letters: SAA 17 40; SAA 17 41; SAA 17 45; SAA 17 70; SAA 17 74. 
f. In literary texts: In a hymn to Nanaya the goddess is beseeched to bless mLUGAL—GI.NA, the shepherd of Assyria SAA 3 4 r. ii 18. 
A badly preserved military account in epic style mentions [m]MAN—GIN in the context of a battle against Elamites, Ellipeans and Anzaneans SAA 3 18 r. 6. The event in question might be the battle at Der in 720. However, it cannot be ruled out that the text describes a victory of a later king (Assur-banipal?), mentioning Sargon as his victorious an-cestor. 
3. The later memory of Sargon:
a. Sennacherib
1′. Sargon is not mentioned in the inscriptions of his son Sennacherib, with the following exception: LUGAL—GIN is mentioned in a broken context in a tablet identified by its editor as an inscription of Sennacherib; it mentions statues of (the god) Aššur and of the king’s father (Sargon) K 4732+:5′= George (1986) 144. 
2′. In letters: In a letter probably from Sennach-erib’s reign [Lanšê] reports on Babylonian affairs and mentions a son of mLUGAL—GIN SAA 17 94 r. 18 (not dated). 
A broken letter mentions mLUGAL—G[IN] several times together with Elam and the Lady of Uruk SAA 17 144 r. 1, 3, 5 (not dated). 
b. Esarhaddon: 1′. In inscriptions: Esarhaddon is the grandson of Sargon, (king of the world,) king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad: mLUGAL—GIN RIMB 2 6.31.11:13 // 12:25 // 15:26 // 17:10; mLUGAL—GI.NA RINAP 4 10:4 // 77:38 // 78:36 // 98 r. 15 // 128:13; m[LUGAL]-GI.NA RINAP 4 93:20; mMAN—GIN RINAP 4 48:47 // 113:6; RIMB 2 6.31.16:10 // 18:9; mLUGAL—GI.[NA] RINAP 4 47:2′. 
Sargon, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad: mMAN—GIN RINAP 4 70:1 // 71:2 // 134:10 // 136:9; BM 113204:10 (cylinder); mLUGAL—GIN RINAP 4 87:4 // 129:25 // 133:26 // 135:10. 
Sargon, (king of the world,) king of Assyria: mMAN—GIN RINAP 4 13:4 // 20:6 // 21:4 // 22:3 // 24:4 // 64:4 // 74:3 // 75:6 // 81:3 // 82:6 // 84:7 // 86:6 // 88:3 // 131:10; RIMB 2 6.31.13:10; BM 134446:4; Prism H:6 (unpublished prism from Babylon); mMAN—[GIN] RIMB 2 6.31.19:9 = RINAP 4 137; [mMAN—GIN] RIMB 2 6.31.21:8 = RINAP 4 139; mLUGAL—GI.NA RINAP 4 1 ii 15; Nin.A5 ii 20 (cf. Borger [1956] 45); RINAP 4 2 i 6; BM 131129:38 = ND 1126; [m]LUGAL—GI.NA RINAP 4 58 iii 1; mLUGAL—GI.[NA] RINAP 4 90:4; LUGAL—GI.NA RINAP 4 59 i 17. 
Sargon, great king, strong king, ...: [m]LUGAL— GI.NA RINAP 4 100:5′. 
Sargon, king of the [four] quar[ters, ...]: [mMAN]—GIN RINAP 4 16:6. 
As the grandfather of Esarhaddon in a dedicatory inscription on a tablet from Uruk: LUGAL—[GIN] RINAP 4 1010:6′. 
2′. In letters: Mar-Issar reports to Esarhaddon on statues of mMAN—GIN which were placed in sanc-tuaries SAA 10 350 r. 12 (671). In another letter Mar-Issar reports to Esarhaddon on the conditions of the Borsippa river “in the days of mMAN—GI.NA and the father of the king [my lord]” SAA 10 364:4 (669). In a letter to either Esarhaddon or Assur-banipal (name of sender not preserved) there are complains about Pulu, lamentation priest in the Nabû temple of Kalhu, who replaced a golden table of Marduk which mLUGAL—ú-kín had had made SAA 13 134:10 (not dated). 
3′. On his seal, Esarhaddon presents himself as the son of Sennacherib and the (grand)son of [m][LUGAL]—GI.[NA] Orient (1993) 110, no. 2.2:4. 
4′. In a literary text now known as “The Sin of Sargon,” Sennacherib is said to have pondered over the death of mLUGAL—GIN, his father, “who was slain in the enemy country and who was not interred in his house” K 4730+ 8′; Sennacherib decided to investigate the sin of mLUGAL—GIN in order to avoid it and to save himself K 4730+ 10′; the sins of mLUGAL—GIN were investigated by means of extispicy K 4730+ 16′; two explanations for the tragic death of [mLUGAL—GIN] seemed possible: either Sargon had placed the gods of Assyria above the gods of Babylonia, or he viol-ated a treaty sworn by the king of the gods K 4730+ 19′; after a prayer on behalf of [mLUGAL—G]IN, his father, it was revealed to him that Assyrian scribes had shortened Sargon’s life by preventing this king from working on the statue of Marduk, after the statue of Aššur had been made K 4730+ 24′. The text was composed in the reign of Esarhaddon to justify his pro-Babylonian policy. Accordingly as a source this text sheds more light on the time of Esarhaddon than on the actual circumstances of Sargon’s demise (cf. Frahm [1997] 227ff, T.186-187). 
5′. In a dedication to Ištar: The king’s grand-father LUGAL—GI[N] is mentioned in a broken con-text RIMB 2 6.31.2001:6′. 
6′. In the inscription on a bowl belonging to Esarhaddon or a descendant of his: The inscription on a stone bowl from Nineveh identifies it as (the property of) [... E]sarhaddon, ..., son of Sennach-erib, ..., descendant of mMAN—GIN king of Assyria RINAP 4 1029:1. 
c. As the father-in-law of Esarhaddon’s mother, Naqi’a/Zakutu: In a prism inscription from Nine-veh preserved in two fragmentary exemplars, Naqi’ a/Zakutu identifies herself as the daughter-in-law of m[MAN?]—[GI].NA, king of the world, king of [Assyria] RINAP 4 2003 i 2′; in a cylinder fragment Naqi’a/Zakutu may be restored as the daughter-in-law of [mMAN—GI.NA, king of the world], king of [Assyria] RINAP 4 2004:4′. A dedicatory inscription on a tablet identifies Naqi’a as the daughter-in-law of mMAN—GI.NA, king of the world, king of Assyria RINAP 4 2005:3; similarly: mLUGAL—GIN, king of the world, king of Assyria RINAP 4 2006 r. 3; and in the inscription on a bead: mMAN—GIN, king of Assyria RINAP 4 2008:4. 
d. Assurbanipal: 1′. In inscriptions, as the king’s ancestor: mLUGAL—GI.NA J1:13 = Borger (1996) 194; L4 i 3′= Borger (1996) 187; mLUGAL—GI.NA Prism T v 38 = Borger (1996) 169; [mLUGAL—GI.NA] K 228+:2′// K 2675:1′= Onasch (1994) II 54. 
2′. In letters: Akkullanu reported to Assurbani-pal on customs which had been in use until the reigns of mMAN—GIN and Sennacherib SAA 10 96 l.e. 1 (not dated).

f. Sin-šarru-iškun: 1′. In inscriptions: Sargon was the king’s ances-tor, the great king, mighty king, king of the world, king of Assyria, governor of Babylon, king of Sumer and Akkad: mLUGAL—GI.NA Sši Cyl.A:15; mLUGAL—GI.NA KAH 2 129:2; mLUGAL—GI.NA KAH 2 134:8; mLUGAL—GI.NA RIMS 1 57:4. 
Title not preserved: mLUGAL—GIN KAH 1 56 5; [mMAN—GIN] KAV 171:5. 
2′. In land grants: [mLUGAL—GI.NA], king of the world, king of Sumer and Akkad SAA 12 43:4 (date lost) // SAA 12 44:4 (date lost). 
g. A broken ritual text of unknown date refers to the time of mLUGAL—GI.NA, king of Assyria Iraq 14 23:1. 
h. Inscribed objects from the Treasury at Perse-polis (Achaemenid period): Bead dedicated to the goddess Aya: mMAN—GIN MAN KUR—AŠ PT4 548a:2 = Schmidt (1957) 57, Pl. 25:1. Eye-stones dedi-cated to Šamaš: [m]LU[GAL]—[GIN] [LUGAL ŠÁR] PT4 495:2 = Schmidt (1957) 58; [mLUG]AL—GIN? [LUGA]L ŠÁR PT6 233:2 = Schmidt (1957) 58, Pl. 25:5. Eye-stone, name of deity lost: [m]MAN—GIN PT4 1170:1′= Schmidt (1957) 58 and n. 87 (refer-ring to two further eye-stone fragments from the same findspot, both inscribed with Sargon’s name: PT 4 1169 and 1172). 
3. An official in spe (reign of Assurbanipal): In a query the sun-god is asked whether Assurbanipal should appoint mLUGAL—ki-nu [to an office] SAA 4 305 r. 6 (650).

2. Military official active in the Urar#ian border region (reign of Sargon II): In a letter to the king reporting on Urar#ian affairs, it is written that the troops of the Urar#ian king have been defeated on his expedition against the Cimmerians, and the governor of Waisi has been killed; also, the caval-rymen under the command of [mLUG]AL!—lu—da-a-ri have disappeared SAA 1 30 r. 4 (not dated); possibly identical with 3.

Given his association with the royal charioteer Remanni-Adad, he may well be identical with 11. 
11. Chariot driver (reign of Esarhaddon, perhaps also early reign of Assurbanipal): In a letter to the queen mother, the sender (name lost, perhaps based in Harran) writes that together with the de-puty of the governor, the deputy of the treasurer, the temple scribe, the priests of the temples of Harran, and mLUGAL—lu—da-ri LÚ.mu-kil—P A.MEŠ, he weighed out and received thirty talents [x+]6 minas of silver SAA 13 188:13 (not dated); mMAN— lu—dà-ri LÚ.DIB—PA.MEŠ is named in a list of offi-cials a court SAA 7 5 r. ii 3 (date broken); possibly identical with 10. 
12. Egyptian conspirator and ally of Sasî (reign of Esarhaddon): In a long letter to the king Bel-ušezib predicts the fall of Mannea.

Nikkû and mLUGAL—lu—dà-ri were brought alive to face the king in Nineveh Prism C iii 6 = Borger (1996) 23. Assurbanipal kept mLUGAL—lu—dà-ri, who had not kept to the agreement, in captivity but took pity on Nikkû and restored him to Sais Prism C iii 8 = Borger (1996) 23. Another account rec-ords that the (rulers of) the cities Sais, Bin#i#i (Mendes) and \a’nu (Tanis) rebelled and made common cause with Tarqû, whereupon Assurbani-pal impaled their leaders and draped their skins over the city walls; he captured mLUGAL—lu—dà-ri, whom the king’s father had installed as king in Egypt, and deported him to Assyria Prism B ii 3 = Borger (1996) 23. 
14. Official active in Babylonia (reign of Esar-haddon or Assurbanipal): A tiny fragment of a Babylonian letter mentions [mLUGAL]—lu—d[a-a-ru] and the town Ša-amele CT 54 356:6 (not dated).

20. Babylonian mayor (reign of Assurbanipal): In a letter of petition to the king, Nabû-balassu-iqbi, possibly based in Borsippa, writes that mLUGAL— lu-ú—da-a-ru has done two things which are unto-ward to the king. First, he appropriated land for himself despite a royal edict concerning the dis-tribution of booty from Akkad. The sender also writes that before mLUGAL—lu-ú—da-a-ru was ap-pointed as mayor, the chief judge had decided his case and had returned to him the people of his father’s estate who had been wrongfully removed.

24. Possibly a “third man” of the governor of Barhalzi, son (or subordinate?) of Adad-uballi# (late reign of Assurbanipal): In a document recor-ding the purchase of an orchard by Issar-nadin-ahhe from four men, the litigation clause stipulates that mMAN—lu—dà-ri, [son?] of Adad-uballi#, LÚ*. 3.U5 [šá LÚ.GAR.K]UR.bar-hal-za has no claim on the land. It is not certain whether Šarru-lu-dari himself or Adad-uballi# is the “third man” since the matter depends on the signs that are lost SAAB 2 7 r. 3 (631*). 
25. House owner, son of Ahu’a-eriba, horse trainer of the chief eunuch of the crown prince (after reign of Assurbanipal): mMAN—lu—dà-ri, son of Ahu’a-eriba, horse trainer of the chief eunuch of the crown prince (LÚ.GIGIR ša LÚ.GAL—SAG šá A—MAN, l. 2), sells a house in Nineveh to his neighbour Kakkullanu for two minas of silver SAA 14 40:1, 17 (625*).

In some cases (e.g. 1. below) it is clear that mMAN— is to be read Šarru-(rather than mU.U—, Dadi-) because the same individual is also attested with the writing mLUGAL. However, in other cases the reading is not so clear-cut; note Dadi-nuri, where the reading is assured through Aramaic writ-ings of the same individual’s name. For those cases below where the individual is only attested with the spelling mMAN— (and not also with mLUGAL—), the alternative reading Dadi-nuri cannot be ruled out.

See Koehler -Baumgartner (1990) 1535f sub šašai (with lengthy discussion and literature); šá-ši-i possibly stands for Šimšai and may be derived from Hebr. šmš “sun”; Tallqvist (1918) 219; cf.

1.

<<M. Weszeli >>.
*Šataparnû(?) (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. [mša-ta(?)]-par-nu-u; the restoration of the name (given by Tadmor [1994] 106 without further commentary) is apparently based on comparison with the names Satarpanu (Median rulers of Uppu-ria and Barikanu, reign of Sargon II) and Šidirpanu (Median ruler in Patušarri, reign of Esarhaddon). The second component of the name (Med.(?) far-nah-“splendour of fortune”), however, is con-nected with a variety of first elements (cf. the references listed in Mayrhofer [1973] 347 s.v. -far-nah-), OPers. cira-“radiating, shining, clear” being only one of them. The restoration remains rather doubtful therefore. See also Justi (1895b) 164; Schmitt (1982) 22f; Schmitt (2000) 145; Schmitt (2009) 142-3; cf. Satarpanu; Šidir-parna.

<<D. Schwemer >>.
*Šataqupi (mng. unknown); possibly Iran.; masc.; wr. mšá-ta-qu-pi; Zadok (1996a) 13 con-sidered the name to be of OIran. character, sugges-ting the numeral sata-“hundred” (see Šatašpa) as its first element; however, this remains specu-lative as the second element is unidentified. Schmitt (2009) 143 regards an Iran. origin as problematic, not least on account of the writing with emphatic q. 
Median city lord of Uparia (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): mšá-ta-qu-pi šá URU.[ú?]-pa-ri-a is one of the Median rulers who bring tribute to Tiglath-pileser in 737; he gives thirty-two horses Tadmor (1994) 106, St.IIB:35. In the same passage Metraku is also named as a ruler of Uparia. 
<<R. Schmitt >>.
*Šatašpa (“Having hundred[s of] horses”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mšá-ta-áš-pa; Zadok (1986) 247 has convincingly interpreted this name as OIran. (Med.) Sataspa-“having (a) hundred (or better: hundreds of) horses,” containing Med. sata-(= Av. sat!m) “hundred” and aspa-(= Av. aspa-, OPers. asa-) “horse”. Thus it can be equated with Elam. šá-(ad-)da-áš-ba and Gk. Sat£sphj (cf. 
Mayrhofer [1973] 229 no. 8.1472; Hinz [1975] 223). It is unlikely that the name bears any relation to OIran. š(y)ati-“happiness” or š(y)ata-“happy, blissful” (as has sometimes been sug-gested) for semantic reasons; in any case, this can now be definitely rejected by reference to Sogd. st’sp /Satasp/ (Sims-Williams [1992] 70); see now Schmitt (2009) 144. 
Median city lord of Šaparda (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): mšá-ta-áš-pa šá URU.ša-pa-ar-[da] is one of the Median rulers who bring tribute to Tiglath-pileser in 737; he contributes 200 horses Tadmor (1994) 106, St.IIB:38.

Zí-ut-ra-bar-na (Hinz -Koch [1987] 1306) and Gk. Te-traförnhj; its OPers. equivalent with initial ciça-is reflected by Gk. Tissaförnhj, S(e)isiförnhj, Aram. ššprn, and Lyc.

2. Tribesman or official(?), possibly from north-ern Babylonia (reign of Sargon II): At the end of a letter to the king regarding a dispute between Nabû-belu-ka’ ’in and Il-iada’ concerning land, Nabû-belu-ka’’in writes that the king had written to him earlier about a certain msu-ma-a who had gone together with a servant of Il-iada’ from Man-diru SAA 15 24 r. 21 (not dated); possibly identical with 3. 
3. Babylonian, son of Nenê, possibly associated with Bit-Dakkuri (reign of Sargon II): In a frag-mentary letter concerned with Bit-Dakkuri, [mš]u-ma-a son of Nenê is mentioned together with Ana-Na[bû-taklak] in a broken context SAA 17 85:9 (not dated); in letter to a high-ranking official at court, possibly from Bel-iqiša, [mšu-ma]-a son of Nenê is named along with [Zeru]-ibni of Babylon and Marduk-apla-iddina SAA 17 30:3 (not dated); possibly identical with 2. 
4. Individual, probably from Nineveh (reign of Sennacherib): mšu-ma-a-a acts as a witness for [...]ši, who buys a garden in Kalgurig from Batu’a SAA 6 113 r. 3 (702). 
5. Soldier of the royal cohort (reign of Sennach-erib): mšu-ma-a ki-$ir—MAN acts as a witness with several other military officials when Sipa[rranu] sells slaves SAA 6 192 r. 6 (682). 
6. Exorcist and astrologer at the court of Nineveh (and Kalhu), son of the chief scribe Nabû-zeru-lešir (reigns of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal): Šumaia is also brother of the chief scribe/astro-loger Issar-šumu-ereš and nephew of the king’s exorcist Adad-šumu-u$ur, though these family ties are nowhere explicitly stated. In a list (SAA 17 50) by Šumaia’s father Nabû-zeru-lešir of people en-tering the palace, three unnamed sons and two daughters of Nabû-zeru-lešir are counted. 
Šumaia regularly writes his own name in the Assyrian way: mšu-ma-a-a. However, his identifi-cation is complicated in the extant sources by others who use the Babylonian form of his name (mšu-ma-a, cf. b. below). This is rather odd because his renowned family is known to have been Assy-rian. Perhaps indirect mockery or scorn (cf. SAA 10 273:13ff) is not to be excluded since these variant writings of his name originate with his colleagues, who were in competition with him. The use of the patronym “son of Nabû-zeru-lešir” (at-tested three times, though not used by Š. himself) may indicate in Šumaia’s case that he was not as illustrious as his father (cf. Parpola [1972] 42). However, it may also have been intended to distin-guish between him and his namesakes at court, especially the Assyrian or Babylonian diviner (9.), who might (in theory) even be identical with Šumaia the exorcist/astrologer. In that case, he would have been earlier diviner, because all or most of the queries to the sun-god which involve Šumaia (Šumâ) precede the exorcist/astrologer Šumaia’s activities (attested from 672 on). As tempting as this possibility would appear, it is hardly plausible, because it would include Šumaia changing the way of writing his own name, from mšu-ma-a to mšu-ma-a-a. 
a. As the author of letters to the crown prince (Assurbanipal): mšu-ma!-[a]-[a] appeals to the crown prince for his accounts to be settled and for him to be appointed to finish up the work formerly assigned to his (probably recently deceased) father in Kalhu SAA 16 34:1 (not dated, but probably early 672); in another letter to the crown prince, mšu-ma-a-a reports how much of the royal barley given to his father remains at his disposal SAA 16 35:2 (not dated, but probably also early 672). 
b. In the letters of other scholars: In a letter to the king, the exorcist Nabû-nadin-šumi disap-proves of mšu-ma-a, who had hastened from Kalhu to perform a ritual for Esarhaddon’s sister Šadditu; he is apparently disgruntled because Esarhaddon had originally ordered the ritual to be performed by Nabû-nadin-šumi himself SAA 10 273:13 (not dated, but attributed to 672); the chief exorcist Marduk-šakin-šumi writes to the king that mšu-ma-a son of Nabû-zeru-[lešir] is one of five “bearded courtiers” who could serve the crown prince in lieu of Remutu, who is said to be ill SAA 10 257 r.7 (not dated, but attributed to 670); in a letter to the king attributed to the exorcist Urdu-Gula, the writer reports that Nabû-gamil and Inurta-ahu-id-dina are both busy and msu-ma-a-a son of Nabû-zeru-lešir is ill SAA 10 291 r. 1 (not dated, but c. 672-669). 
c. As the author of astrological reports: The exorcist Šumaia, son of Nabû-zeru-lešir, is most likely the author of six Assyrian astrological re-ports (to the king), although in view of the fre-quency of the name Šumaia some uncertainty as to his identification necessarily remains: mšu-ma-a-a reports on the appearance of Venus before reach-ing Cancer in Simanu (iii.) SAA 8 175 r. 8 (666); mšu-ma-a-a reports on the new moon on 30th %ebetu (X) SAA 8 176 r. 1 (not dated); mšu-ma-a-a reports on the full moon on 16th Du’uzu (IV) SAA 8 177 r. 5 (not dated); mšu-ma-a-a reports on Cancer in the lunar halo SAA 8 178 r. 6 (not dated); mšu-ma-a-[a] is the author of a poorly preserved report concerning an eclipse SAA 8 179 r. 7 (not dated); mšu-ma-[a-a] reports on Saturn(?) in Leo SAA 8 180 r. 5 (not dated). 
d. As a witness in a legal document: [mM]U!-a-a son of m[d!][PA—NUMUN—GIŠ] acts as a witness (fol-lowing Issar-šumu-ereš and Adad-šumu-u$ur) for Remanni-Adad, who purchases an estate in Ispal-lurê SAA 6 314 r. 13 (666); possibly identical with 25. 
7. Son of Ša[maš-...], from Nineveh or Kalhu (reign of Esarhaddon): mMU-a-a son of Ša[maš-...] acts as the first witness for Nabû’a, who buys two slaves; the penalty clause mentions the god Nabû of Kalhu SAA 6 284 r. 12 (671). 
8. Diviner at the court of Nineveh (reign of Esarhaddon): mšu-ma-a, Bel-ušallim and Nabû-ušallim perform an extispicy for Esarhaddon to determine whether Mugallu of Melid will mobilize an army against Mannu-ki-[...], the magnates and army of Assyria during a thirty-day period between 11th Ajjaru (ii.) and 10th Simanu (iii.) SAA 4 5 r. 10 (not dated or date lost); mšu-ma-a and Bel-ušal-lim perform an extispicy to determine whether Mugallu (of Melid), Iškallû of Tabal or any other enemy will attack the Assyrian army led by Ša-Nabû-šû, chief eunuch of Esarhaddon SAA 4 9 r. 10 (not dated, but cf. Bel-ušallim 3.); mšu-ma-a and Be[l-ušallim] perform an extispicy to deter-mine whether Mugallu of Melid has good inten-tions in sending a messenger of his to Esarhaddon to conclude a treaty SAA 4 12 r. 10 (not dated); [mšu-ma-a?] and Bel-ušallim perform an extispicy to determine whether Dusanni of Saparda or Ka-štaritu of Karkaššî might appear with an army before the city [...] within a thirty-day period be-tween 3rd Ajjaru (ii.) and 2nd Simanu (iii.) SAA 4 45 r. 13 (no year date); in another fragmentary extispicy by mšu-ma-[a (and) Bel-ušallim?] the same Kaštaritu appears in a broken context SAA 4 59 r. 6 (not dated or date lost); mšu-ma-a and [Nabû-ušallim?] perform an extispicy to determine if Urtaku is sincere in trying to make peace with Esarhaddon SAA 4 74 r. 1 (year lost, but date can be restored as 6-II-[674]); mšu-ma-a and [Bel-ušal-lim?] perform an extispicy to determine if Ba’alti-nurija should go to the aid of Tunî, city lord of Ellipi SAA 4 76 r. 7 (no year date); [mš]u-ma-a and Nabû-ušallim perform an extispicy on 26 Abu (v.) to determine if the enemy has captured the city \i$$irtu, a fortress of Harhar on the border of Ellipi SAA 4 77 r. 11 (no year date); in an extispicy performed on 8th Ululu (vi.), [m]šu-ma-a and Nabû-ušallim ask the sun-god whether Esarhaddon should admit an unnamed man into his entourage SAA 4 152 r. 13 (no year date); mšu-ma-[a] is also attested as performing an extispicy in two badly broken queries to the sun-god SAA 4 222 r. 2 (not dated) and mšu-[ma-a] SAA 4 228 r. 3 (date lost). 
9. Son of Kabtia(?), possibly a messenger or a Babylonian scholar (reign of Esarhaddon): Kudur-ru writes to the king a Babylonian letter in which he says that he dispatched a plant of life to the king via mšu-ma-a son of Kabtia(?) SAA 10 371:16 (not dated, but can be dated 671-669). 
10. Babylonian, details unknown (possibly reign of Esarhaddon): [mšu-m]a-a is named in a badly broken Babylonian letter along with Esagil-[...] and several other men CT 54 226:4 (not dated); possibly identical with 11. and/or 12. 
11. Babylonian, father of [...] (reign of Esarhad-don or Assurbanipal): [...] son of mšu-m[a-a] is mentioned in a fragmentarily preserved Babylo-nian letter CT 54 445 r. 3 (not dated); possibly identical with 10. and/or 12. 
12. Babylonian official(?), probably of the Gam-bulu region (possibly reign of Esarhaddon or As-surbanipal): mšu-ma-a writes in a Babylonian letter to the king that he has heeded the king’s command by taking (the statues of) the gods to the city of Zanaki and that the people (of the city) had ga-thered (to see this). However, the prefect Nabû-šarru-ibni has laid (his) hands on [...].

13. Babylonian astrologer of the new cohort, possibly from Ur (probably reign of Assurbanipal): mšu-ma-a reports to the king concerning the new moon on the 1st day SAA 8 498 r. 6 (not dated); mšu-ma-a LÚ.DUB.SAR UD—AN—d+EN.LÍL šá ki-i$-ri eš-šú reports to the king on the full moon on 15th Nisannu (i.)

17. Son of Šumu-iddina, from the Babylonian Gahal family (reign of Assurbanipal): Bel-ibni of the Sealand writes a Babylonian letter to the king reporting that after mšu-ma-a son of Šumu-iddina from the Gahal family, also son of the sister of Tammaritu, had fled from Elam, he (Bel-ibni) caught(?) him.

19. Father of Abi-Ammâ, probably from Uruk (reign of Assurbanipal): Abi-Ammâ writes a letter to his father m?[šu-m]a-a of which little more than the greeting formula is preserved CT 54 475:2 (not dated). 
20. Prelate (šatammu) of Nikkal, son of Nabû-ahhe-iddina, from Kissik (reign of Assurbanipal): In a Babylonian letter to the king attributed to Bel-ibni, mšu-[ma-a] LÚ.ŠÀ.TAM šá dNIN.GAL LÚ.ki-sik-a-[a x x] is said to have been one of the leading figures assisting the troops of Nabû-bel-šumati in a fight with Bel-ibni ABL 1000:18 = de Vaan (1995) 292-6 (not dated); in another Babylonian letter (sender’s name lost) to the king, possibly from Ur, relating partly to the same events and the same people as the previous, mšu-ma-a son of Nabû-ahhe-iddina is named as one of the allies of Nabû-bel-šumati who have captured people of the writer’s family and household ABL 963 r. 4 (not dated). 
21. Scribe from Nineveh (after reign of Assur-banipal): mMU-a-a LÚ.A.BA acts as a witness for the cohort commander Kakkullanu who exchanges a slave woman of his for a male slave SAA 14 39 r. 14 (625*); mMU-a-a LÚ*.A.BA acts as a witness (and probably writes the document) on behalf of Kak-kullanu who leases land SAA 14 41 l.e. 2 (625*); possibly identical with Sumaia 3. 
22. Individual from Assur (after reign of Assur-banipal): mMU-a-a acts as a witness when Aššur-reši-išši, Aššur-kettu-irâm and Aššur-nadin divide their inheritance StAT 2 263 r. 22 (622*); possibly identical with 15. and/or 16.

24. Individual from Nineveh: mMU-[a]-[a] has sixty sheaves, according to a harvest record SAA 11 24:4 (not dated). 
25. Possibly a high temple official active in Assur: According to an administrative list from Assur, mMU-a-a has a large number of white sheep-skins and ox-skins (written both KUŠ GUD and KUŠ GUD.NITÁ-ME) at his disposal. He may be the author or otherwise responsible for the document since he is the only person named (four times). Probably the skins were intended for the rituals or ceremonies of various temples on the first four days of the month (month or year not given), because the priests of the Gula, Ištar, and Šarrat-nipha temples, as well as the city scribe and the temple scribe (of the Aššur temple) are mentioned as having white sheep-skins and/or ox-skins at their disposal. On the 4th day, Šumaia either has to pay or he is the beneficiary of a tax (on cattle) of forty-seven white sheep-skins KAV 76:6, 8, r. 8, 10 (not dated); possibly identical with 6. In addition to the fact that the chief scribe is mentioned after Šumaia in the document, the archival context (the prince’s palace in Assur, archive N5) could support the identification of this Šumaia with the exorcist (6.), brother of the chief scribe Issar-šumu-ereš. There-fore a date in the late reign of Esarhaddon or early reign of Assurbanipal seems possible.

1. Chariot-driver from Nineveh (late reign of Sargon II and reign of Sennacherib): Only a few texts explicitly mention Šumma-ilani’s role as cha-riot-driver. Among these, he is once described as chariot-driver of the “royal corps” (ki$ir-šarri), and once as the chariot-driver of the chamberlain (ša-muhhi-betani). We may therefore be dealing here with a progression from one office to another, since he held the former in 709 and the latter in 692. However, there remains some uncertainty about the reading of ki$ir-šarri since it is written with the personal determinative (see Kwasman [1988] 408f no. 355 and Kwasman -Parpola [1991] 38 n. 34; also Ki$ir-šarri).

More-over, a son of the governor (i.e. Šumu-iddina; the son is possibly Inurta-gamil), currently being held in confinement in Assyria, is also accused by Bel-ušezib of smuggling(?) gold and Babylonian lux-uries to his father, who in turn gives them to (his accomplices) Sasî (Sasia) [...] and \illaia. He writes that perhaps they are saying nice things about [mMU—SUM-na] (r. 7); the king should know that there is a conspiracy afoot and [mMU—SUM]-na (r. 9) has his hands in it. Bel-ušezib also warns that the Egyptian Šarru-lu-dari may have been induced to join the conspiracy of mMU—SUM-na (r. 13) SAA 10 112 r. 1, 7, 9, 13 (not dated, but can be attributed to 676 or 675); see Nissinen (1998) 138. Event-ually Šumu-iddina was punished for his role in the conspiracy: An entry in the (Babylonian) Esarhad-don Chronicle for his sixth regnal (675) year states that in an unknown month mMU—MU LÚ.GÚ.EN.NA and Kudurru of Bit-Dakkuri were transported to Assyria Borger (1956) 123, Chron. 675/4; see also Grayson (1975) 84:14.

5. Probably the prelate (šatammu) or another high-ranking member of the personnel of the Esagil temple in Babylon (reign of Esarhaddon): a. As the author of Babylonian letters to the king: mMU—SUM-na reports on the progress of the work on a royal statue by him and Mar-Issar, a statue to be set up in Babylon; on two eunuchs, who had fled from Assyria and were hidden by the royal dele-gate, first in his house and then in Borsippa. Fur-thermore, Šumu-iddina informs the king that he captured one (other) eunuch about whom the king has written to him and that the governor has not seen Imbâ, of the Gallabu family, the “measurer” of the governor, who has come from Elam SAA 13 178:1 (not dated; possibly 670, cf. Nissinen [1998] 131f); [mMU]—SUM-n[a] reports on the statue of Bel and a Chaldean chieftain (mar Dakkuri) who is making trouble in Malilati and Apak SAA 13 181:2 (not dated). It should be noted that the authorship of the Babylonian letters SAA 13 179-180 and 182-185 cannot be ascribed with certainty (cf. Contents, p. X). They mainly treat Babylonian matters and some or even all of them may have been written by Šumu-iddina. 
b. Mentioned in other people’s letters: In a Ba-bylonian letter to the king concerning divine statues and their ornaments, Raši-il reports that Marduk-zeru-ibni has opened the chests (under) the seals of mMU—SUM-na and has removed gems from them. It is uncertain whether these gems are those mentioned in ll. 19-21; if so, then the chests were opened without the permission of the priest (LÚ.SANGA, i.e. Šumu-iddina?) and Nabû-e#ir-na-pšati SAA 13 174 r. 13 (not dated). Most likely the same mMU—SUM-na is named along with Ubaru (governor of Babylon) in a poorly preserved Baby-lonian letter SAA 18 15 r. 6 (not dated).€ Nissinen (1998) 70f.

8. Father of Šumaia, member of the Babylonian Gahal family (reign of Assurbanipal): According to a Babylonian letter of Bel-ibni to the king, Šumaia son of mMU—SUM-na of the Gahal family, a son of the sister of Tammaritu, had fled from Elam but he (Bel-ibni) had caught(?) him. Bel-ibni writes that he is going to send Šumaia to the king as soon as he (Šumaia) recovers from an illness ABL 282:7 = de Vaan (1995) 248-252 (not dated).

10.

11. Prelate (šatammu) of Der (possibly reign of Assurbanipal): In a Babylonian letter to the king Nabû-zeru-ukin writes that he has given the king’s seal to Mušezib-Marduk. He himself has the seal intended for mMU—MU LÚ.ŠÀ.TAM šá BÀD.DINGIR.KI but is not going to give it to him because mMU—MU should know the anger(?) of the king (za-nit LUGAL) SAA 18 163:14, 17 (not dated, but cf. Nabû-zeru-ukin 2.).€ Frame (1992) 274 n. 33.

Šutruk/Šutur-Nahhunte; Tallqvist (1918) 227; Cameron (1936) 158-63; Lambert (1967); Hinz (1972) 140-43, 145-47; Zadok (1984a) 29-30, 41 (with the meaning “right, law” for šutur); Stolper (1984) 45-47; Hinz -Koch (1987) 792, 1187; Vallat (1995). There are two distinguishable individuals bearing this name in Neo-Assyrian sources and several, including private individuals, who bear the name Šutruk/Šutur-Nahhunte in Neo-Elamite sources. There are references in Neo-Elamite inscriptions to (at least) two kings named Šutur-/Šutruk-Nahhunte. It is uncertain which of these attesta-tions match the Neo-Assyrian ones. Controversy persists as to whether Neo-Elamite Šutruk and Šutur are variant spellings of the same name or indicate different names; cf., for example, Lambert (1967); Vallat (1995); Waters (2000) 111-16; Tavernier (2004) 7-15.
1. Šutruk-Nahhunte II, king of Elam, 717-699 (reigns of Sargon II and Sennacherib): The Baby-lonian Chronicle names iš-tar—hu-un-du as the nephew (“son of his sister,” mar ahatišu) of his predecessor Hu(m)ban-nikaš (I) and the brother of Hallušu Grayson (1975) 75 i 40, 77 ii 32-33. The significance of the use of “Ištarhundu” to represent Šutur-nahundi is unknown (cf. Issar-duri for the Urar#ian king Sarduri), but the identification is secured by the parallel attestations of Šutur-nahun-di in Sargon’s and Sennacherib’s annals. This Šutur-nahundi is traditionally identified in scholar-ly literature with the Šutruk-Nahhunte II who auth-ored dedicatory inscriptions found at Susa (König [1965] nos. 72-73; Malbran-Labat [1995] no. 57), which identify his father as Huban-immena and his ancestors as Huteluduš-Inšušinak and Šilhina-hamru-Lagamar of the Middle Elamite period (late 12th century). 
In 710 Sargon defeated Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) and mšu-túr—dna-hu-un-di on the river Uqnû Fuchs (1994) Ann.288; Sargon overcame the towns Sam’unu and Bab-duri, for-tresses which mšu-tur—dna-hu-un-di LÚ.NIM.MA.KI had built in the vicinity of Iadburu Fuchs (1994) Ann.295; following an account of Sargon’s defeat of many towns in the Elamite border region, it is stated that mšu!-[túr]—dna-hu-un!-di fled in the face of the Assyrian king’s weaponry in order to save his life Fuchs (1994) Ann.303. Subsequently Mar-duk-apla-iddina left Babylon in fear of the Assy-rian advance and fled to Iadburu. He offered precious gifts to mšu-túr—na-hu-un-di LÚ.NIM.MA. KI-i in order to secure his support, but having received them the Elamite was fearful of Sargon and did not provide the expected aid Fuchs (1994) Ann.308. Once Babylonia was secure, Sargon for-tified the border with Elam. 
Šutur-nahundi also clashed with Sargon over Ellipi in 708. The princes Nibê and Ašpa-bara, nephews of the former king Daltâ, sought aid from Šutur-nahundi and Sargon respectively. Two pas-sages in Sargon’s inscriptions recount Nibê’s at-tempt to secure the support of mšu-túr—dna-hu-un-di LÚ.NIM.MA.KI-i // [mšu-túr—dna]-[hu]-un-d[i LÚ. NIM.MA.KI-i] Fuchs (1994) Prunk.119 // Ann.416. Sargon’s client Ašpa-bara was victorious, though Ašpa-bara was the target of a later campaign by Sennacherib in 702. By the battle of Halule in 691 Ellipi was in the Elamite camp again. Several let-ters (SAA 15 112-115) from Šamaš-belu-u$ur to Sargon track the movements of the Elamite king, whose name is not given, in and around the region of Bit-Bunakki. In one (SAA 15 113:19-22) it is specifically noted that the Elamite king will march to Ellipi, so these letters probably refer to Elamite and Assyrian activities on behalf of Nibê and Ašpa-bara respectively. SAA 1 13 (beginning broken), which refers to conflict with Elam in the central Zagros (Sumurzu and Urammu), may also fit into this sequence. 
After the death of Sargon, Šutur-nahundi joined forces with Marduk-apla-iddina in 703 against Sennacherib: Marduk-apla-iddina brought over to his side mšu-túr—dna-hu-du LÚ.[e]-[lam-ú], giving him gold, silver and precious stones in order to secure him as an ally Luckenbill (1924) 49:7; cf. Grayson (1975) 77 ii 19-23. However, Sennacherib defeated the coalition of Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites in battles waged near Kish and Kutha, and then installed his client Bel-ibni in Babylon. Ac-cording to the Babylonian Chronicle, in the first year of the Babylonian ruler Aššur-nadin-šumi, Šutur-nahundi lost his throne to his brother Hal-lušu who seized Šutur-nahundi and “shut the door in his face” (Grayson [1975] 77 ii 32-33); no addi-tional details are provided. 
According to Assurbanipal’ s inscriptions, a statue of miš-tar—na-an-hu-un-di was among sev-eral Elamite royal statues taken to Assyria follow-ingthesackofSusain647*PrismAvi53//Fv 37 = Borger (1996) 54.€ Waters (2000) 16-24. 
2. Elamite ruler of Hidalu, ?-653 (reign of As-surbanipal): Following Assurbanipal’ s victorious campaign against Teumman, the head of the Elamite king Teumman was hung from the neck of Dunanu and the head of [m]iš-tar—na-an-di was hung from the neck of Samgunu (Šama’gunu), younger brother of Dunanu Prism C vii 49 = Borger (1996) 106. Epigraphs indicate that Umbakidini, the herald of Hidalu, beheaded Ištarnandi and cast his head before Assurbanipal’s magnates; two such inscriptions identify him as king of Hidalu: miš-tar—na-an-di MAN ša KUR.hi-da-li Rb 3 I 6 (K 2674+) = Borger (1996) 299; miš-tar—na-an-di LUGAL KUR.hi-da-lu Rb C:6′(K 1914+) = Borger (1996) 306; Russell (1999) 158. Editions B and C of A ssurbanipal’ s annals assign the defeat of Teumman to the king’s seventh campaign and that of Gambulu to his eighth campaign, however, the later prisms A and F combine the two (B vi 17 // C vii 10 = Borger [1996] 105; A iii 52-69 // F ii 74-iii 5 = Borger [1996] 38-39). Thus it is uncertain whether Ištarnandi ruled concurrently with Teum-man or in the period between Teumman’s over-throw and Ištarnandi’ s own defeat. A ssurbanipal’ s subsequent installation of his clients, the Elamite princes Ummanigaš II and Tammaritu I, probably mirrors the political situation in Elam in 653, that is, the simultaneous rule of Teumman and Ištarnan-di (Waters [2000] 54ff).

*Šuzubu (hypocor. of a name containing an ele-ment formed with šuzubu “to save” ); Akk. (Bab.); masc.; wr. mšu-zu-bu, mšu-zu-bi; prominent Baby-lonians named Mušezib-Marduk and Nergal-ušezib were both known by this name (though not by their actual names) in the Assyrian sources. 
1. Babylonian (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): A fragmentary letter probably concerned with events during the Mukin-zeri rebellion in Babylonia con-tains reports on several individuals, including mšu-zu-[bi] ND 2456:15′= CTN 5 82-4 (not dated). 
2. Nergal-ušezib, member of the Gahal family, king of Babylon 694-693 (reign of Sennacherib): In 694 the Babylonians who had left with Marduk-apla-iddina (Merodach-baladan) and fled to Elam several years earlier came to Babylon together with the Elamite king (Hallušu) and placed mšu-zu-bu, “son” (= descendant) of Gahal, on the royal throne there Luckenbill (1924) 87:28. On returning from Elam during his sixth campaign, the king defeated in battle mšu-zu-bu DUMU—KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI who had made himself ruler of Sumer and Akkad; he captured him alone and deported him to Assyria in chains Luckenbill (1924) 38:46; the king’s troops drove the Elamite king away and marched as far as Uruk; on their return they captured mšu-zu-bu LUGAL KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI alive in battle Luckenbill (1924) 87:34 // 90:13; mšu-zu-bu LUGAL KÁ.DIN-GIR.RA.KI and his people were captured alive and taken to Assyria Luckenbill (1924) 83:46 (H3); he was deported to Nineveh and tied up in the city gate. According to an epigraph on a palace relief, mšu-zu-bu, the terrified king, an usurper (LUGAL IM.GI) who made himself king of Babylon, fell off his horse in fear of the king’s approach Luckenbill (1924) 156, I36:14. The Babylonian Chronicle rec-ords that, while king, Nergal-ušezib captured and plundered Nippur (16-IV) and later clashed with the Assyrian army near Nippur (7-VII), whereupon Nergal-ušezib was captured and taken to Assyria. In the same month the Elamite king Hallušu-In-šušinak was deposed and replaced by Kutur-Nahhunte.€ Brinkman (1984) 61f (for further details of his short reign). 
3. Mušezib-Marduk, Chaldean leader of the Bit-Dakkuri tribe, king of Babylon 692-689 (reign of Sennacherib): Mušezib-Marduk seems originally to have been loyal to Assyria as a subordinate of the governor of Lahiru. By 700 he had rebelled but he and the Chaldeans were defeated in Bit-Dakkuri and he was forced to seek refuge in Elam. On his return, he was made king of Babylon. 
In his fourth campaign, directed against Bit-Iakin in 700, Sennacherib claims to have defeated mšu-zu-bi LÚ.kal-dà-a-a, who dwelled in the midst of the swamps, at Bitutu Luckenbill (1924) 34:53 // 71:33. During Sennacherib’ s eighth campaign, after mšu-zu-bi had revolted and the residents of Babylon closed their city gates, mšu-zu-bu LÚ.kal-dà-a-a, a (former) servant of the governor of Lahi-ru, gathered Aramean fugitives and criminals around him; they fled to the marshes and rebelled Luckenbill (1924) 41:17, 20; the king pursued them and he (Šuzubu) then fled to Elam but could not stay there owing to intrigue against him. He went to Babylon where the people put him on the throne. He then used the treasures of the Esagil temple to bribe the Elamite king Ummanmenanu to come to his assistance (Luckenbill [1924] 42 v 31-34). When the Elamites reached Babylon they exchanged courtesies with mšu-zu-bi LÚ.kal-dà-a-a LUGAL KÁ.DINGIR.RA.KI Luckenbill (1924) 43 v 54. Babylon was subsequently besieged and then cap-tured bu Sennacherib whereupon Mušezib-Marduk and his family were taken to Assyria but nothing is known of their subsequent fate; see Frame (1992) 52. 
4. Babylonian (reign of Assurbanipal): mšu-zu-bu writes a letter to his lord Aqarâ in which he complains that he has been cheated out of his share of his inheritance by Tabnea, his brother, and is facing ruin. He also reports on the misconduct of a certain Aplaia SAA 18 160:2 (not dated).

É.GAL-ia), as queen over the Arabs and returned her to her land, together with her gods RINAP 1 iv 15 // 2 ii 60 // 3 iii 3′// 6 iii′9′; MÍ.ta-bu-u-[a] RINAP 4 97:12. Her installation as queen of the Arabs and the return to Arabia appear in the inscriptions of Esar-haddon after the episode recording that Haza-il, king of the Arabs, came to Nineveh bearing gifts to beg for the return of the divine images taken from him by Sennacherib.

On the other hand, the inscriptions of Assurbanipal connect the two episodes, implying that Haza-il requested the return of MÍ.ta-bu-a and her gods Borger (1996) 70:13.€ Eph‘al (1982) 43, 122f, 125, 127f.

The name Tammaritu (and vari-ants) is common in Assurbanipal’s annals and in the Neo-Assyrian correspondence of the late 650s and early 640s. Only in rare instances is the indi-vidual in question identified by more than his name (e.g., by a familial relationship or title), and such differentiation is restricted to the royal inscrip-tions. There are three distinct Tammaritus in the sources, and since they were all contemporaries it is impossible in most instances to discern which Tammaritu was intended. In the light of Tammaritu II’s heavy involvement with Assyria, it is probable that many of the relevant letters refer to him. 
1. Tammaritu I, king of Hidalu, 653-?, son of the Elamite king Urtaku, brother of Ummanigaš (II) and Ummanappa (reign of Assurbanipal): After the death of king Urtaku the new king of Elam, Teum-man, sought to kill the sons and nephews of Urtaku who fled to Assyria and sought refuge with Assur-banipal. Their flight can be dated to 664 by a reference in the Šamaš-šumu-ukin Chronicle: it is stated that on 12th Tašritu (vii.) of the fourth year of Šamaš-šumu-ukin, the Elamite prince fled [to] Assyria (Grayson [1975] 128:2-3). According to Assurbanipal’ s inscriptions, Ummanigaš, Umma-nappa and mtam-ma-ri-tu // mtam-ma-ri-tú, the sons of Urtaku, king of Elam, together with Kudurru and Parrû, the sons of Ummanaldašu, the king who preceded Urtaku, and sixty members of the royal household plus countless Elamite troops and others fled from Teumman’s slaughter and sought refuge with Assurbanipal Prism B iv 79 // C v 85 = Borger (1996) 97. Assurbanipal mounted his second campaign against Elam, directed against Teumman, who had kept sending his envoys with a view to extraditing Ummanigaš, Ummanappa and mtam-ma-ri-tu // mtam-ma-ri-tú, sons of Urta-ku, king of Elam, as well as Kudurru and Parrû, sons of Ummanaldašu, brother of Urtaku, king of Elam, who had fled and sought refuge with him; however, Assurbanipal did not permit their extradition Prism B iv 89 // C v 96 = Borger (1996) 97. A broken passage similarly mentions Ummani-gaš, Ummanappa, mtam-ma-ri-tú, Kudurru [and Parrû ...] K 3140:1′(SKT 3 74) = Streck (1916) 220. After the defeat of Teumman in 653 or poss-ibly earlier, Assurbanipal installed Ummanigaš (II) as king of Elam and mtam-ma-ri-tú // mtam-ma-ri-tu // mtam-ma-ri-tu // mtam-ma-ri-tú // mta-[am]-ri-ti // [mtam-ma]-ri-tu, his “third brother,” as king of Hidalu Prism A iii 48 // F ii 70 = Borger (1996) 38; Prism B vi 8 // C vii 1 = Borger (1996) 104; Prism H3 iii 1 = Borger (1996) 192; IIT:102 = Fuchs (1996) 277. No other details of his reign are known. 
In a letter addressed to Assurbanipal by the [el-ders of Elam], the writers report on disorder and sheep-rustling by the Persians; they ask for [mta]-am-ma-ri-ti and Kudurru to be sent quickly with troops, mta-am-ri-ti to Hidalu and Kudurru to the city Iahdik ABL 961:11, 13 (not dated); see Waters (2000) 59 n. 19. 
A Neo-Babylonian economic text (BM 79013) dated to the accession year of mtam-mar-[ri]-[tu] [LUGAL] NIM.MA.KI was attributed to this Tammari-tu by its editor but, although drafted in Hidalu, it was more probably written in the reign of Tam-maritu (II) king of Elam (see 2.) BM 79013:26f = Leichty (1983) 154.€ Waters (2000) 56-61. 
2. Tammaritu II, king of Elam c. 652-649 (reign of Assurbanipal): a. In the inscriptions of Assurbanipal: One in-scription identifies mtam-ma-ri-tu as the son(?) (DUMU) of Ummanigaš and the brother of his father (ŠEŠ AD-šú), without giving his father’s name K 2654:18′= Borger (1996) 83. Solutions to this seemingly impossible genealogical situation in-clude understanding DUMU as “heir, successor” or assuming that the possessive suffix “his” refers not to Tammaritu but to someone else. If the former is correct and this Ummanigaš was the son of Urtaku (i.e. Ummanigaš II), Tammaritu’s father could have been Ummanappa, Tammaritu (I), or some otherwise unattested brother of Ummanigaš. Fuchs (2003) 134-7 (followed tentatively by Waters [2006] 63f) proposed that Tammaritu’s father Um-manigaš was the uncle of Ummanigaš II mentioned four lines previously and therefore an otherwise unattested brother of Urtaku. Another inscription may indicate that [mtam-ma-ri-t]u was not the brother (la ahi) of Ummanigaš (i.e. he was not Tammaritu I) K 1364:14 = CT 53 48; see Borger (1996) 320. 
Assurbanipal’s inscriptions record that mtam-ma-ri-tú (var. mtam-re-e-tu) revolted against Um-manigaš and struck him down by his sword, together with his family Prism A iv 1 // B vii 43 // C viii 33 // F iii 10 = Borger (1996) 41; after mtam-ma-ri-tú // mtam-ma-ri-tu ascended the throne in place of Ummanigaš, he failed to pay court to Assurbanipal but rather formed an alliance against the Assyrian king with Šamaš-šumu-ukin, from whom he accepted bribes Prism A iv 3 // B vii45//Cviii35//Fiii12 = Borger (1996) 41.

MA.KI] had proudly brandished in Elam against Assyrian troops — those bows were now close at hand (to Assurbanipal) in Assyria Prism C viii 69 = Borger (1996) 149. Indabibi is referred to as the successor of Tammaritu: Indabibi, who occupied the Elamite throne after mtam-ma-ri-tu // mtam-ma-ri-t[i], released the Assyrian captives who had been imprisoned in Elam by Nabû-bel-šumati Prism B vii 77 // C ix 45 = Borger (1996) 112. Indabibi reigned for only a short time before being deposed in a revolt and replaced by Ummanaldašu III, probably following the fall of Babylon in 648 (Waters [2000] 64-8). In 647 or possibly 648, As-surbanipal mounted his first campaign against Um-manaldašu. On this campaign he took with him mtam-ma-ri-tú MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI, who had fled from his servant Indabibi Prism A iv 114 // F iii 37 = Borger (1996) 46; mtam-ma-ri-[tu] K 2656+:13 = Borger (1996) 156. When Ummanaldašu heard that Assurbanipal had entered Elam, he abandoned his royal city Madaktu and fled; UmmanHABua brief-ly occupied the Elamite throne before he, like his predecessor, fled.

The statue of mtam-ma-ri-tu EGIR-ú (“the later,” i.e. the second king of that name) was among the Elamite royal statues taken to Assyria following the sack of Susa Prism Avi55// Fv38 = Borger (1996) 54;this statue of [mtam-ma-ri-tu], who fled from Elam and submitted to Assurbanipal, is referred to in another inscription in which the king states that he brought it to Assyria K 3062+:1 = Borger (1996) 54f. A passage concerning Nabû-bel-šumati names Um-manigaš, mtam-ma-ri-tú, Indabibi and Ummanal-dašu as the Elamite kings in whom the rebel placed his trust Prism A vii 22 = Borger (1996) 59. A fragmentary passage mentions mtam-ma-ri-tu MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI, a fugitive who went [...] from As-syria to Elam Prism C ix 13′= Borger (1996) 159. 
b. In the official correspondence: A number of letters from the royal correspondence also mention Tammaritu, though their placing within the se-quence of events described in the royal inscriptions is not always clear. Also, it is not always certain whether Tammaritu I or II is intended. 
1′. As the recipient of letters from the king: A letter from Assurbanipal to [mtam-ma]r-ít MAN KUR.NIM.MA.K[I] mentions the rebel Nabû-bel-šumati and [Umma]naldasi (presumably Umma-naldašu III) in a broken context. At the close of the letter the king insists that Tammaritu return all the favours that had been done to him, probably invok-ing his loyalty agreement (adê) ABL 1022:2 (no year date, but see Waters [2000] 73f for the attribu-tion to Tammaritu II and a date during his second tenure as king of Elam). In a letter from Bel-ibni to Assurbanipal, which must be dated later since it concerns military actions against the Elamite king, mtam-m[ar-i-ti] is named in a broken context and then the author refers to something that the mess-engers of mtam-mar-i-ti said; [mtam-mar]-i-ti is mentioned again in connection with the city Hida-lu, and some people are said to have come to the assistance of mtam-m[ar-i-ti LUGAL] KUR.NIM.MA. KI; they gathered with mtam-mar-i-ti along the river Hudhud; mtam-mar-i-tu LUGAL? is again mentioned in a broken context ABL 1311+:15, 17, 26, 27, 30, 36 = de Vaan (1995) 311-17 (not dated). The con-tents of another letter from Assurbanipal to mtam-mar-ít LUGAL KUR.NI[M.MA.KI] are mostly lost ABL 1040:3 (not dated). Assurbanipal addresses a letter to [m]tam-mar-í[t] concerning events in Bit-Bunakki CT 53 908:1 (not dated). In a small frag-ment of what is probably a royal letter, [mtam-ma-ri]-ti LUGAL KUR.N[IM.MA.KI] is mentioned CT 53 664:7′(not dated). 
2′. In letters from the king to Ambappi and the people of Rašu: The king addresses a letter to Ambappi and the people of the land Rašu, mention-ing the food he had supplied to Elam, and his request to Ummanaldašu to extradite Nabû-bel-šumati; mtam-mar-ít is mentioned in a broken pas-sage ABL 1260 r. 13 (not dated). Another royal letter to the people of Rašu mentions assistance given to Elam in a time of famine during the reign of Urtaku; it is stated that if a certain person becomes attentive to Assurbanipal’s case, then he may come and stand together with mtam-mar-ít; otherwise the king will do whatever the gods urge ABL 295 r. 6 (not dated). 
3′. As the author of letters to the king: mta-am-ma-ri-tú LU[GAL KUR.NIM.MA-KI] addresses a letter to the king praising him for his good deeds ABL 1400:2 (not dated); mtam-mar-ít addresses a letter to the king, saying that he has heard of the king’s friendly overtures; mtam-mar-ít is mentioned in a broken passage ABL 943:2 (not dated). 
4′. In a letter of Assurbanipal to Menanu: A letter to the Elamite Menanu from Assurbanipal men-tions a previous letter that the king had sent to both Menanu and mtam-mar-i-ti commending them for their actions in planning to overthrow Ummanigaš (II) ABL 1380:15 (not dated); presumably Tam-maritu II, the king who replaced Ummanigaš, is the individual in question (see Waters [2000] 61 for further discussion of the letter). 
5′. In the letters of Bel-ibni: A letter of Bel-ibni to Assurbanipal mentions the flight of Šumaia, son of Šumu-ibni, of the Gahal family, a nephew (son of his sister, DUMU—NIN-šú) of mtam-ma-ri-ti who has fled. Bel-ibni promises to send the fugitive to Assurbanipal once he has recovered from an illness ABL 282:8 = de Vaan (1995) 248-52 (not dated); Waters (2000) 64 tentatively suggests that this episode is related to the flight of Tammaritu and his entourage. In any case, another letter of Bel-ibni makes it clear that Tammaritu first fled to him: Bel-ibni writes concerning mtam-mar!-i-ti, his bro-thers, family and nobles, about whom he had writ-ten to the king; he says that he has now sent mtam-mar-i-ti, his brothers, family and nobles to the king ABL 284:7, 10 = de Vaan (1995) 252-3 (not dated). Another letter ascribed to Bel-ibni mentions mtam-ma-ri-ti // mtam-ma-ri-ti [LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA].KI ABL 1130 r. 5, 7 = de Vaan (1995) 300-4 (not dated). A broken passage of another letter of Bel-ibni mentions Indabibi, mtam-ma-[ri-i-tú] and the rebel Nabû-bel-šumati ABL 1459 r. 2 = de Vaan (1995) 326-6 (not dated). 
6′. In the letters of other officials: A letter to the king (name of sender lost) reports on Marduk-šarru-u$ur, possibly the Assyrian eunuch captured at one time by Nabû-bel-šumati; he had gone to [m]tam-mar-i-te in search of food ABL 960:7′(not dated). A letter from Illil-bani (governor of Nip-pur) to the king contains a report on Elam, men-tioning mtam-ma-ri-i-[ti] [LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI] who has apparently left the land Arašu; the details are mostly lost SAA 18 193:7 (not dated). A Baby-lonian letter to the king mentions mtam-ma-ri-ti in a broken context ABL 1116:18 (not dated); another poorly preserved letter mentions a herald who is an ally of someone and also refers to the family of mta5-am-mar-ti CT 54 520 r. 3 (not dated). A small fragment of a letter mentions mtam-ma[r-i-ti LUGAL KUR.N]IM.MA.KI and Marduk-šarru-u$ur and forty of their magnates in connection with the cities Tihalani and Targibati CT 54 487:2′(not dated). 
c. As the subject of an extispicy report: An extispicy report is concerned with ascertaining whether mtam-mar-i-ti MAN KUR.NIM.KI // [m]tam-mar-[i]-[ti] MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI is going to make a hostile incursion into Assyrian territory, or an at-tack against Nippur SAA 4 289:2, 7 (not dated); such a possibility would presumably have arisen only after Nippur had been captured by the Assy-rians, therefore the report may be dated after Šaba#u (xi.) of 651 and shows that Tammaritu was king by that date (Waters [2000] 62). 
d. In a dating formula: A Neo-Babylonian econ-omic text (BM 79013), a testament of Bel-epuš son of Bala#u, was drafted in Hidalu in the accession year of mtam-mar-[ri]-[tu] [LUGAL] NIM.MA.KI (“king of Elam”) BM 79013:26f = Leichty (1983) 154; the editor assigned the document to Tammari-tu I, but as this Tammaritu is only otherwise known as the king of Hidalu (rather than of Elam), an attribution to Tammaritu II is more probable (Wa-ters [2000] 56f). 
e. Depicted on a relief: Tammaritu may have been one of the two Elamite kings depicted on a relief fallen into Room S of the North Palace at Nineveh (part of the “Garden Scene” of Assurbani-pal, BM 124794), whose names are not preserved in accompanying epigraph (though it is perhaps more likely that they are Pa’ê and Ummanaldašu) (Gerardi [1988] 209f; Barnett [1976] pl. XXXIV and p. 57). 
3. Tammaritu I or II? (reign of Assurbanipal): A Babylonian letter to the king from Nabû-ušabši, governor of Uruk (c. 661-649), describes the find-ing by shepherds in the vicinity of Ru’ua of three white horses with silver trappings inscribed as follows: [(property of mta-a]m-ma-ri-ti [x]-il te-ep-pi-ir LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI ABL 268 b.e. 17 (not dated); a copy of the letter in Neo-Assyrian script is also extant, though Tammaritu’s name is not preserved ABL 751+ (not dated).€ Frame (1986) 266. 
4. Tammaritu, son of the Elamite king Teumman (reign of Assurbanipal): Tammaritu and his se-vered head were depicted several times on reliefs in Room XXXIII of the South-West Palace of Sen-nacherib at Nineveh. Epigraphs on the reliefs and on clay tablets contain the only explicit references to Tammaritu, the eldest son of Teumman: mtam-ri-i-tu DUMU-šú [GAL]-u Gerardi (1988) 31 (South-west Palace, Room 33, Slab 3:2); [mtam-ma-ri-tu] DUMU-šú GAL-u Rb 9 I 25 = Borger (1996) 300; Russell (1999) 159, 169f. The epigraphs and the reliefs record the flight of Teumman and Tammari-tu into a forest after the defeat of their forces at Til-Tuba. After their chariot was wrecked, Teum-man pleaded desperately to his son to “take up the bow”, but they were discovered by Assyrian sol-diers and beheaded in front of each other.

*Tammeš-idri (“Samš is my help”); WSem.; masc.; wr. mtam-meš—id-ri; cf. Tamsunu. Assyrian former prisoner-of-war in Elam (reign of Assurbanipal): In a letter to the king, Na’di-Aššur mentions mtam-meš—id-ri as one of the eight Assyrians formerly imprisoned in Elam; he writes that he has released and sent them to the palace ABL 1430 r. 4 (not dated). 
<<N. Alhadeff >>.
*Tammeš-natan (“Samš has given”); WSem.; masc.; wr. mtam-meš—na-tan, mtam-meš—na-ta-nu. 
1. Cavalryman from Kalhu (reign of Tiglath-pileser III or Sargon II): mtam-meš—na-tan son of [...]-Zababa is mentioned in a list of cavalrymen ND 2479 r. 3 (not dated).
2. Father of Šamaš-ibni and grandfather of Bali-hitu, from Bit-Ibâ in Babylonia (reign of Assur-banipal): In a letter to Assurbanipal, Bel-e#ir, ruler of Bit-Ibâ, mentions Ibâ and three women, namely Hulalitu, Rihtu and Balihitu, daughter of Šamaš-
ibni (chief of the Chaldean tribe of Bit-Dakkuri), the mtam-meš—na-ta-nu, denouncing the fact that the people of Bit-Ibâ have no love for the king ABL 454:15 (not dated). 
<<N. Alhadeff >>.
*Tamranu (mng. uncertain); Sem.; masc.; wr. mta-am-ra-a-nu; Zadok (1977a) 114f (suggesting a derivation either from tam(a)r “palm” [common Sem., except Akk.] or from tmr “to be fruitful” [Arab.; Aram. tmr]), 161 (on the ending -an); for the latter interpretation cf. Minean and Sabean (Harding [1971] 148). Tmrn/Ša-am-ra-na is re-corded in Ugarit (Gröndahl [1967] 199). Hayajneh (1998) 109 s.v. tmr lists Qat. Tmry and Saf. Tmr, both deriving from tmr “fruit, crops”. 
Military official (reign of Tiglath-pileser III or Sargon II): Together with two cohort commanders and another man, mta-am-ra-a-nu is in charge of a mutual exchange of fugitives between the woman Samsi (probably the queen of the Arabs) and the Assyrians SAA 11 162:12 (not dated). 
<<N. Alhadeff >>.
*Tamrû (mng. unknown); Arab.?; masc.; wr. mtam-ru-u; probably the same derivation as Tam-ranu q.v., with Arab. nominative ending -u. Elamite prince, enemy of Assyria (reign of As-surbanipal): In an incantation Bel-e#ir, ruler of Bit-Ibâ, is warned not to collaborate with Amman-ipite, mtam-[ru?]-u and Haimbia SAA 3 30:8 (not dated). In the editor’s translation he is tentatively identified with Tammaritu (though this would not be consistent with the etymology suggested here). 
For the context see Livingstone (1989) xxviii. 
<<N. Alhadeff >>.
*Tamsunu (perhaps based on a dialectal form of Samš “sun” with adjectival ending -an, i.e. “Sunny”); WSem.; masc.; wr. mta-am-su-nu; cf. Šamšanu on the one hand and LB mìl-ta5-míš-šú-nu (Donbaz -Stolper [1997] 20:5) on the other. 
Individual from Assur (reign of Assurbanipal): mta-am-su-nu acts as a witness for Ilu-pija-u$ur who buys a female slave Rfdn 17 1 r. 10 (642*).

*Tamurtašu (“His audience gift”); Akk.; fem.; wr. MÍ.ta-mur-ta-šú (assuming /a/ > [o] in closed syllable ending in /r/).
W oman from Assur (reign of Assurbanipal): MÍ.ta-mur-ta-šú owes five shekels of silver to Pu-qulaia Radner (forthcoming) II.2:3 (647*). 
<<H. Baker >>.
*Tamuzaiu (“Born in the month of Tamuz [Du’uzu, the 4th month]”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mITI. ŠU-a-a; perhaps better: Dûzaiu or Du’uzaiu; Tall-qvist (1918) 72 (s.v. Du’uzaia); cf. Tamuzitu.
1. Individual from Kalhu (reign of Assurbanipal or later): A debt of silver is repaid to mITI.ŠU-a-a, according to a fragmentary memorandum ND 3478:5 (not dated, but can be roughly dated by the archival context).
2. Member of staff of the Nabû temple in Kalhu (probably late reign of Assurbanipal): In a list concerned with various functions in the Nabû temple in Kalhu, mITI.ŠU-a-a and two unnamed brothers of his are serving in the bet qate of the temple administrator (SANGA) Sumer 30 64 r. 1 (not dated).€ Postgate (1974c) 66. 
3. Individual active in Ma’allanate (reign of As-surbanipal): mITI.ŠU-a-a acts as a witness for Har-ranaiu who is owed silver by Tarku-šarrutu, village manager of the governor of Dur-Šarrukin O 3696 r. 8 (659). 
4. Deceased gardener from Sumuqiti (reign of Assurbanipal or later): The slave Attar-nuri is ac-quired by Kusasu from Raši-ili as blood money in lieu of the dead mITI.ŠU-a-[a] LÚ*.NU.GIŠ.SAR URU. su-mu-qi-ti SAAB 9 77:5 (date lost).

*Tamuzitu (“The one [fem.] born in the month Tamuz [= Du’uzu, the 4th month]”); Akk.; fem.; wr. MÍ.ITI.ŠU-i-tú, MÍ.ITI.ŠU-te; perhaps better: Dû-zitu or Du’uzitu; cf. Tamuzaiu. 
1. Egyptian woman, daughter of Urdu-Nanaia, from Assur (reign of Assurbanipal or later): MÍ-ITI.ŠU-te mu-$ur, daughter of Urdu-Nanaia, is listed with two shekels in a tablet of accounts relating to the first trading venture of Ki$ir-Nabû Radner (forthcoming) I.35:9 (not dated).

*Tandaiu (“Sealander”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mta-an-da-a-a, mta-an-da; a gentilic based on (mat) tâmti “Sealand”; cf. Zadok (1999) 690 ad 217a. 
City lord of Qirbit in the area of Harehasta/Hale-haste, in the Elamite border region (reign of Assur-banipal): In his fourth campaign Assurbanipal went to the city Qirbit in Harehasta; mta-an-da-a-a, their city lord, is said not to have been submissive to the king’s forebears, and the people of Qirbit were constantly plundering the land Iamutbal Prism B iii 7 // C iv 17 = Borger (1996) 94; the king took mta-an-da // m[ta]-[an-da] their city lord to Assyria, together with the booty of his city; he deported the inhabitants of Qirbit to Egypt Prism B iii 12 // C iv 25 = Borger (1996) 94. A different account records that mta-an-da-a-a LÚ.EN—URU had been insubmissive to the king’s forebears and had constantly plundered the land Iamutbal and devas-tated its steppe. On account of these deeds the inhabitants of Der appealed to the king, who sent his eunuchs; they conquered the city Qirbit and removed its inhabitants, whom the king resettled in Egypt LET r. 14 = Onasch (1994) I 108-109 + 147; II 78; a variant mentions m[ta-an]-[da-a-a] in a broken passage and then goes on to record that the king’s eunuchs conquered Qirbit and over a dozen cities in the region, and killed mta-an-da-a-a LÚ.EN—URU Stück 12:33 = Borger (1996) 180. 
<<N. Alhadeff >>.
*Tanê (mng. uncertain); WSem.; masc.; wr. mta-ni-e; cf. Tallqvist (1918) 69. The name is homony-mous with a WSem., presumably Aramean, tribe which is first attested together with the Aramean tribe of Hindaru and with Naqru in the so-called “governor’ s archive” from mid-8th century BC Nippur (see Lipinski [2000] 471); it features slightly later in an annalistic text of Tiglath-pileser III after Nasikku and Naqru. The name may derive from Aram. (OSyr., Samar.) tny “to repeat, count” (see Zadok [1985a] 78f; cf. the Sabean clan name d-Tnym). The etymology suggested by Lipinski [2000] 471f is unlikely. He disassociates Dur-Tanê of the Chaldean territory of Bit-Sa’alli from Sen-nacherib’s time. However, this is simply a typical case of “toponymie en mirroir” and cannot be dis-carded because there are numerous analogies, e.g. Suqa-Marusi of Bit-Dakkuri, another Chaldean ter-ritory in the same list.
Father of Bih-ahhe, a servant of the treasurer of the city of Qarat-baqa’ani, near Guzana (reign of Adad-nerari III): In a memorandum from Guzana Bih-ahhe, son of mta-ni-e, is one of three servants of the treasurer of Qarat-baqa’ani who are said to be criminals TH 23:4 (not dated, but belongs to the archive of Mannu-ki-mat-Aššur 1.)

*Tangî (possibly a qal imperf. 2nd pers. sing. fem. of ngh “shine”); WSem.; fem.; wr. MÍ.ta-an-gi-i; Zadok (1977a) 96; cf. Nagahî.
Woman, probably a deportee, in Kalhu (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): MÍ.ta-an-gi-i is listed with six other women in a section of an administrative do-cument probably concerned with deportees ND 2443+ v 14 (not dated or date lost, but cf. Bel-Har-ran-belu-u$ur 2.).

*Tanis-dê (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mta-ni-is—de-e. 
Arab active in Dur-Katlimmu/Magdalu (reign of Sennacherib): mta-ni-is—de-e LÚ.ar-b[a]-a-a acts as a witness when Ugî sells a garden to a buyer whose name is lost; he is also said to be the “master of the silver brought” (EN KÙ.BABBAR na-še-e) BATSH 6 130 r. 3′(692). 
<<H. Baker >>.
*Tannanu (“The strong one”?); Elam.; masc.; wr. mta-an-na-a-nu; see Zadok (1984a) 43 (in Elamite onomastics this spelling reflects Akk. dannu “strong”). 
“Third-man” of the Elamite army at the battle of Kish in 703 (reign of Sennacherib): The Elamite king Šutu(r)-nahundi (Šutur-Nahhunte II) sent Am-bappi, commander-in-chief, and mta-an-na-a-nu LÚ.3.U5 with ten cohort commanders, Nergal-na$ir the Sutean and some archers to assist his ally the Babylonian king Marduk-apla-iddina II (Mero-dach-baladan) in the war against Sennacherib Luc-kenbill (1924) 49:8; however, when Sennacherib confronted Marduk-apla-iddina near Kish during his first campaign, he fled to the land Guzummanu; mta-an-na-a-nu and the Elamite troops, together with the Chaldeans and Arameans, were defeated by Sennacherib in 703 Luckenbill (1924) 51:27.€ Frahm (1997) 42ff (for discussion of this episode).

*Tanus (mng. unknown); probably Iran.; masc.; wr. mta-nu-us; this name was considered to be Iranian by Tallqvist (1918) 230a, 311b, who referred to Justi (1895b) 513 for names ending in Iran. -tanu-“body”. The same possibility (i.e. a shortened name OIran. Tanuš) was considered also by Grantovskij (1962) 260; Grantovskij (1970) 237, without excluding the alternative possibility that the preserved Tanus[... (cf. D′jako-nov [1956] 201 n. 1) is only the scanty initial of a compound name beginning with Tanu:-s/ç. But see now Schmitt (2009) 149f.
Ruler of a west Iranian city or country (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): mta-nu-us is mentioned in a broken context in a passage concerned with the conquest of several Iranian cities by Tiglath-pileser Tadmor (1994) Ann.14:12 (not dated). Tad-mor (1994) 71 suggests that he is possibly to be identified with Tunî of Sumurzu who is attested in Ann.12:4.

King of Egypt and Kush (25th dynasty) 664-656, son of Šabakû, nephew and successor of Tarqû (Taharqa) (reign of Assurbanipal): At the begin-ning of his reign Assurbanipal reports that after the death of Taharqa he enthroned mUR-da-ma-né-e son of Šabaku (var.: the son of his [Taharqa’s] sister) during his first campaign to Egypt Prism A ii 22 // Bii10//Ciii28 = Borger (1996) 24, 214; K 228+:71′(and variants) = Onasch (1994) II 73.

2′. In the Annals: In his third regnal year the king fought and defeated mta-ar-hu—la-[ra] [KUR.gúr-gu]-ma-a-a and Sulumal of Melid Tadmor (1994) Ann.17:4′.

D+E v 60 = Iraq 16 183 (Kalhu prisms). Shorter inscriptions also refer to the deportation of Tarhu-lara: Sargon claims to have deported Gunzinanu, ruler of Kam-manu, and mtar-hu—la-ra KUR.gúr-gu-ma-a-a and annexed their lands to Assyria Fuchs (1994) Stier.26. In a variant account, Sargon removed the kingship of mtar-hu—la-ra LÚ.URU.mar-qa-sa-a-a // mtar-hu—la-ra URU.mar-qa-sa-a-a and annexed the land of Gurgum to Assyria Fuchs (1994) S4:28 // XIV:10.

D+E v 41 = Iraq 16 182.

In the inscriptions of Esarhaddon, Te’elhunu is called Apkallatu, apparently a title which the Assyrians misunderstood to be her name; she was brought back to Assyria in 689/8 together with booty. Inscriptions of Assurbanipal relate the defeat of Haza-il at the hands of Sennach-erib and his subsequent submission to the king’s father, Esarhaddon.

*Teumman (hypocor. of Tepti-Hu(m)ban-In-šušinak, “Lord Hu(m)ban is Inšušinak”?); Elam.; masc.; wr. mte-um-man, mtú-um-man; Tallqvist (1918) 232; Zadok (1984a) 13; Stolper (1984) 50; Hinz -Koch (1987) 321. 
1. King of Elam 664-653, brother of the Elamite kings Ummanaldašu I, Ummanaldašu II, Urtaku and possibly also brother of Ummanigaš, father of Tammaritu, Undasu and Ummanaldašu (reigns of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal): Three key epi-sodes in the life of Teumman are documented: his involvement in the Sealand (680-675), his acces-sion (664) and his defeat (653); see Waters (1999b) 475. 
The date of Teumman’s accession is usually assigned to 664, based on the assumption that his predecessor Urtaku died in the same year that As-surbanipal attacked Egypt; see Frame (1992) 119 n. 93 for discussion of the chronological problems. In Assurbanipal’s inscriptions Teumman is de-scribed pejoratively as tamšil galle (“image of a gallu-demon”), revealing a hostile attitude towards him from his very first mention. His anti-Assyrian activity began already during the reign of Esarhad-don, when as brother of the reigning Elamite king Ummanaldašu II (681-675) he supported Nabû-ušallim’s bid to wrest control of the Sealand from its governor, his brother Na’id-Marduk. 
Edition B of Assurbanipal’s annals provides a lengthy and detailed account of the Assyrian cam-paign against Teumman in 653 (Borger [1996] 97-101). It relates Teumman’s repeated demands (via his envoys at the Assyrian court) for the extradition of the sons of Ummanigaš (II) and Ur-taku, who had fled to Assurbanipal after Teumman became king. According to this account, Teumman persisted in his insane desire to confront the Assy-rians despite a host of evil portents. Assyrian forces delivered a crushing defeat to Teumman and his forces at Til-Tuba along the Ulaya River, after which he and his son Tammaritu were both be-headed. The battle and its aftermath were also celebrated in an extensive sequence of reliefs and accompanying epigraphs, one relief portraying Teumman’s head as a gruesome backdrop to As-surbanipal and his queen banqueting in Nineveh (see Reade [1983] 68, fig. 102). 
The identification of this Teumman with the Tepti-Hu(m)ban-Inšušinak who dedicated several inscriptions at Susa (see König [1965] nos. 79-85 and Malbran-Labat [1995] nos. 59-62) is proble-matic, but it cannot be ruled out based on the available evidence; cf. Vallat (1996) 385f; Waters (2000) 47f; Waters (2006) 65f. 
a. As brother of the king of Elam during the reign of Esarhaddon: In a letter to the king, the elders of the Sealand report that messengers have come to them more than once from mtú-um-man, brother of the king of Elam, (and from) the herald, and Zine-ni, asking them to follow the lead of Nabû-ušallim, their lord’s son. The Sealanders write they did not agree, but affirmed that their lord Na’id-Marduk was still alive, and that they were servants of the king of Assyria. They would only accept him (Nabû-ušallim) as their superior if the Assyrian king himself installed him over them SAA 18 86:8 (not dated); the king of Elam mentioned as Teum-man’s brother here may be identified as Ummanal-dašu (Huban-haltaš) II (Reynolds [2003] xxv; Wa-ters [1999b] 474); see also Na’di-Marduk 2.

NIM.MA.KI, who was wounded in battle, was taken by the hand by his son Tammaritu and they fled to save their lives and hid in a forest; however, As-surbanipal killed them and cut off their heads in front of one another Gerardi (1988) 31:1 (Room XXXIII, slab 3:1). An epigraph from the same room records the installation of Ummanigaš on the throne of mte-um-[man] whom Assurbanipal had conquered Gerardi (1988) 32:5 (Room XXXIII, slabe 5). A plaque containing epigraphs refers to the defeat of mte-um-man LUGAL at Til-Tuba Ger-ardi (1988) 34, B:2. An epigraph from the North Palace at Nineveh refers to Itunî, eunuch of mte-um-man, whom he (Teumman) “continually (and) insolently sent before me” Gerardi (1988) 22:1 (Room I, slab 1). An epigraph from the South-West Palace refers to Urtaku, an in-law of mte-um-man, who was wounded in battle and begged to be killed Gerardi (1988) 30:1 (Room XXXIII, slab 2). 
e. In a letter to the Elders of Elam: Assurbanipal responds to a secret message of the Elamite elders in which they have asked why Assyria is treating them in such a way. He expresses disbelief that they might be unaware of the reason, and goes on to explain that it is because of Nabû-bel-šumati, Nabû-qati-$abat and Kiribtu. He also reminds them that when Ummanigaš sought refuge with him so that Assurbanipal sent his troops with him to fight against mte-um-man, they did not lay their hands on temples, cities or anything BM 132980:13 = Wa-ters (2002a) 81f. 
f. In a composition concerned with the defeat of Teumman: A broken passage mentions [the prin-ces?] who had fled before the king and concerning whom mte-um-man [had sent envoys ...] SAA 3 31:5′; upon hearing of Teumman’s insolent words, Assurbanipal asked Ištar of Arbail: “Why is [mte-u]m-man falling upon me?” SAA 3 31:17′.

g. As the father of Undasu: In 652, when the Babylonian king Šamaš-šumu-ukin had revolted against his brother Assurbanipal, the Elamite king Ummanigaš commanded Undasu, son of mte-um-man LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI // [mte-um-man LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI], as well as Zazaz, Parrû, Atta-metu and Nešu, to fight the Assyrians.

*Teušpâ (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.: wr. mte-uš-pa-a. This name has often been considered to be of Iran. origin (cf. Tallqvist [1918] 232b). However, all such etymological pro-posals (e.g. by Marquart [1905] 105f n. 5 [OIran.

e. In an inscription of Shalmaneser III, as the father of Aššur-dan II, builder of the Tabira Gate of Aššur: mGIŠ.TUKUL-ti—DUMU.UŠ—É.ŠÁR.RA, RIMA 3 A.0.102.46:6. 
3. Tiglath-pileser III, king of Assyria (744-727): a. Accession to the throne: A poorly preserved land grant mentions kings Adad-nerari III and m[GIŠ].[TUKUL]-ti—A—É.ŠÁR.RA SAA 12 13 r. 3 (762); Kataja -Whiting (1995) xxiv (raising the possibility that the grant was written while Tiglath-pileser was governor of Kalhu, prior to his becom-ing king; however, this remains uncertain). 
In the Eponym Chronicle entry for the year 746 it is said that there was a rebellion in Kalhu. In the entry for the following year, 745, it is recorded that [mTUKUL]-ti—A—É.ŠÁR.RA took the throne on the 13th day of Ajjaru (ii.), and in Tašritu (vii.) he went to Mesopotamia (lit. “between-the-rivers”) Epo-nym Chronicle 745 (B1:76′-77′). 
b. Family: mTUKUL-ti—A—É.ŠÁR.RA is called “son of Adad-nerari” on an inscribed brick from Assur Tadmor (1994) Misc.III.1:1. However, as Tadmor points out, this may mean that he was the grandson (rather than son) of Adad-nerari. One copy of the Assyrian King List calls [mG]IŠ.TUKUL-ti—A— É.ŠAR.RA the son of his predecessor, Aššur-nerari (V) JNES 13 223 iv 24 (SDAS List). His queen was Iabâ, according to the inscriptions on two gold bowls found in Tomb II beneath the pavement of room 49 in the domestic quarter of the North-West Palace at Kalhu. One text calls Iabâ the queen (and) wife of mGIŠ.TUKUL—A—É.ŠÁR.RA Kamil (1999) 14 no. 1, the other refers to her simply as queen of m TUKUL— A—É.ŠÁR Kamil (1999) 14 no. 2. The ala-baster funerary tablet of Iabâ, bearing a much longer inscription, makes no mention of the king her spouse BaM 21 462 (not dated). See al-Rawi (2008) 119-24, 136-8 (for further discussion and new editions of the grave inscriptions); also Oates -Oates (2001) 81-4 (on Tomb II). He was the father of his immediate successor Shalmaneser V and of the following king, Sargon II. 
c. Military campaigns: 1′. The following year-by-year summary follows the account of Tadmor (1994) 232-7: 745 — north-ern and eastern Babylonia; T. defeated Aramean tribes near Dur-Kurigalzu and east of the Tigris, and deported them to the north-eastern provinces; 744 — first Median campaign; 743 — defeat of Urar#ian king Sarduri (Issar-duri) (II) and his Anat-olian allies; 742 — siege of Arpad begun; 741 — siege of Arpad continued; 740 — fall of Arpad and annexation of the region (Bit-Agusi); 739 — cam-paign against Ulluba; 738 — subjugation of north-ern Syria, annexation of Unqi and Hatarikka; re-ceived tribute from western vassals including kings of Damascus and Samaria; 737 — second Median campaign; 736 — not preserved; 735 — into Urar#u as far of Sarduri’s capital Turušpa; 734 — to Philistia and Egyptian border; received tribute of Judah, Ammon, Moab, Edom and the Arabs; 733 — against coalition of Rahianu (Rezin) of Damas-cus and Paqaha (Peqah) of Israel; siege of Damas-cus begun; campaigns against Arabs and to Gilead and Galilee; 732 — fall of Damascus; annexation of Galilee and Transjordan; 731 — Chaldean chief-tains of central and southern Babylonia defeated; siege of Šapiya; 730 — according to the Eponym Chronicle, the king remained in Assyria; 729 — defeat of Babylonian king (Nabû-)Mukin-zeri; T. ascended Babylonian throne and celebrated New Year’s festival (of Babylonian year 728); 728 — T. again particpated in New Year’s festival (of 727); 727 — T. died in the month %ebetu (X) during his second year as Babylonian king. 
2′. Region-by-region: Babylonia: T. campaigned in northern and eastern Babylonia, defeating the Aramean tribes near Dur-Kurigalzu and east of the Tigris and deporting them to the north-eastern pro-vinces (745); he defeated the Chaldean chieftains of central and southern Babylonia and besieged Šapiya (731); he defeated the Babylonian king (Nabû-)Mukin-zeri and became king of Babylon himself (729), in which role he participated twice in the New Year’s festival (728, 727), dying to-wards the end of his second year on the Babylonian throne (X-727). 
Media: T. conducted two campaigns against Media, in 744 and 737. 
Urar#u: In 743 T. defeated the Urar#ian king Sarduri II and his allies from Anatolia and Arpad; in 735 he penetrated Urar#ian territory as far as Sarduri’s capital Turušpa. 
Ulluba: T. campaigned against Ulluba in 739. 
Arpad: T. defeated Arpad, an ally of Sarduri (II) of Urar#u (743); in the following year (742) he began the siege of Arpad which continued until its fall in 740 when he annexed the region of Bit-Agusi. 
Syria: In 738 annexed Unqi and Hatarikka; in the same year Rahianu (Rezin), king of Damascus was among the western vassals who gave tribute to T.; later on Rahianu formed an anti-Assyrian coalition with Hi-rumu (Hiram) of Tyre, and in 733 T. began the siege of Damascus which lasted until its fall in 732. 
Israel: In 733 or 732 T. attacked Israel and its king Paqaha was killed; T. installed (his assassin) Awsea’ (Hosea) in his place. 
Southern Levant: In 734 T. campaigned to Phil-istia and the Egyptian border, receiving tribute from Judah, Ammon, Moab, Edom; in 733 he cam-paigned to Gilead and Galilee, and in 732 he an-nexed Galilee and Transjordan. 
Arabs: The Arabs were among those who gave tribute to T. in 734; in the following year, 733, he campaigned against them. 
d. As eponym for the year 743: 1′. In versions of the Eponym List: mTUKUL-ti— DUMU.UŠ—É.ŠÁR.RA // mTUKUL-ti—A—É.ŠÁR.RA // m[TUKUL-ti]—[A]—[É].Š[AR.RA] // mIGI.DUB—A—É. ŠÁ[R.R]A // mIGI.DUB—A—É.ŠÁR.RA Eponym List 743(A1iv26,A2v6,A3ii12′,A5i1,A7viii 10). 
2′. In the Eponym Chronicle: [mIGI.DUB—A—É. ŠÁR.RA] Eponym Chronicle 743 (B1:79′); the entry refers to a campaign to Arpad and a victory over Urar#u. 
3′. As the eponym dating legal texts from Kalhu: mTUKUL-t[i]—A—É.ŠÁR.RA CTN 2 26 l.e. 1; mTUKUL-t[i?—A—É.ŠÁR.RA] CTN 2 27 r. 14; mTU[KUL-ti]—A?— É.(ŠÁR).[R]A CTN 2 28 r. 2. 
e. In the date formula of a legal document from Kalhu: A slave purchase document was drawn up in the eponymy of Nabû-da’ ’inanni, commander-in-chief, in the reign of mTUKUL-ti—A—[É].[ŠÁR.RA king of Assyria] SAA 6 1 r. 21 (742). 
f. In the colophon of a text from Assur: A short hymn from Assur, written in 733 according to its colophon, refers to the time of mTUKUL—A—É.ŠÁR. RA king of Assyria LKA 36:5 = Hunger (1968) 290:1 (733). 
g. As the instigator of royal grants and decrees: A fragmentary tablet records a grant of land and people by [mTUKUL-t]i—DUMU.UŠ—É.ŠÁR.R[A] SAA 12 14 r. 2 (730); an even more fragmentary land grant mentions [mTUKUL-ti—A]—É.ŠÁR.RA LUGAL KUR—[aš-šur]; presumably the grant was made by him SAA 12 15:12; two further fragments may belong: SAA 12 16 and SAA 12 17. A decree in favour of several men, including Mutakkil-Aššur, and their descendants was issued by [mTUKUL-ti]— [A]—É.[ŠÁR.RA]; the details are mostly lost SAA 12 75 r. 1 (date lost); a collection of decrees from various reigns refers to an obligation to supply a litre of wine which was laid down by mTUKUL-ti— A —[É.ŠÁR] SA A 12 77 i 17 (date lost, but the text also mentions Sargon II). 
h. In the inscription on the Tell Abta stele of herald Bel-Harran-belu-u$ur: Bel-Harran-belu-u$ur, palace herald of m[TUKUL-ti]—A—É.[ŠÁR.RA], claims to have built a city in the desert, according to his inscription on the Tell Abta stele RIMA 3 A.0.105.2:9. The original king’s name in this in-scription was Salmanu-ašared, but it was erased and with replaced with the name Tukulti-apil-Ešarra. It is assumed in the edition (followed by PNA p. 301) that the former king was Shalmaneser IV and the latter Tiglath-pileser III. However, Reade (apud Kataja -Whiting [1995] 91, caption to Fig. 15) raises the possibility that the stele dates from the reign of Shalmaneser V. In this case the name would have been changed to conform with Sargon II’s attempt to obliterate the memory of his predecessor Shalmaneser V following his violent overthrow. If this is correct, then the career of Bel-Harran-belu-u$ur 2. would have been con-siderably shorter than has hitherto been supposed and the fact that different palace heralds are at-tested for the years 778 (reign of Shalmaneser IV) and 751 (reign of Aššur-nerari V) would no longer have to be reconciled with his supposedly long tenure of office. (Thanks are owed to M. Roaf for drawing this alternative interpretation to my atten-tion and discussing its implications.)

<<G. Van >>.Buylaere *Tunaku (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mtu-na-ku; Tallqvist (1918) 235a. This name has long been recognised as undoubtedly foreign (Tallqvist [1918] 235a, 311b; Cameron [1936] 147). Already Tallqvist (1918) 266b and Hüsing (1930) 259 have seen in it an Iran. hypocor. formation with the suffix -aka-, although the basic word is unclear. 
As with Hüsing, Grantovskij (1962) 260 first con-sidered an “inexact” rendering of Iran. tanu-“body” (as in Tanus), but rightly abandoned this idea. Later Grantovskij (1970) 227f; Grantovskij (1971) 302 preferred a connection with the root tunuvant-“strong” (an old participle) must be kept separate and NA Bagatuna (ABL 1454) is now read Baga-parna, the only parallel nasal formation based on this root would be Sogd. twn /Tun/; thus the whole remains quite uncertain. Cf. Schmitt (2009) 157f. 
Possibly the king of Parsua(?) (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): In 744 Tiglath-pileser captured Kitpat-tia in Bit-Abdadani in western Iran, a city which had been seized earlier by mtu-na-ku Tadmor (1994) Ann.11:4.

Grantovskij [1970] 236). One might suppose that it is a hypo-cor. formation (in OIran. -iya-) from the same base as Tunaku, but not a patronymic (as Zadok [1979c] 299 n. 91 would have it). See now also Schmitt (2009) 158f.

Aia-#aba; %abî. In Neo-Babylonian there is clear evi-dence for the same individual being known both as %abija and %ab-$il-Marduk, the former being a shortened form of the latter (see Pedersén [2005] 230); thus it may well be that the astrologer %abija (below, 2.) is identical with %ab-$il-Marduk 1. This also means that a rendering %ab-Aia has to be ruled out, at least in a Babylonian context. 
1. Babylonian, father of Ašaredu (reign of Sar-gon II): In a letter of Šumu-ukin to Nergal-na$ir, Ašaredu son of mDÙG.GA-ia is said to have been given six minas (of silver); this is one of a number of disbursements detailed by the sender, who is accounting to Nergal-na$ir for the expenditure of silver which the latter claims is rightfully his SAA 17 139 r. 6 (not dated, but the second year of the Babylonian king Marduk-apla-iddina II is men-tioned in ll. 15-16 and probably also r. 17-18).

1. Team commander active in Kalhu (reign of Sargon II): mDÙG.GA-na-a-a is serving under the recruitment officer Ubru-Harran, according to a horse list CTN 3 99 r. ii 5 (not dated); Dalley -Postgate (1984) 175 suggest emending the name to %abaiu or %abalaiu.

The second element may be derived from the root rhi “to beget” with the meaning “Good is the child” or, more probably in view of the tablet’s region of origin, it may be related to Aram. ruh(a) “spirit” with ending -it. A connection with Akk. ruhû “magic” seems unlike-ly.

Economic matters: In response to the king’s order, mDÙG.GA—$il—É.[ŠÁR.RA] gives a detailed account of how many beams were damaged in a fire and how many remained intact SAA 1 100:2 (not dated); mDÙG!—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA (tablet: mIM—$il— É.ŠÁR.RA) and Na’di-ilu (chief cupbearer) report on their progress in cutting timber in Lurisite, as the king had ordered them to do; the details are broken but they mention coming to Assur and some action of the chief eunuch. Currently the men whom they took downstream are cutting the timber SAA 1 98:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA writes that the logs about which the king wrote are too many to count SAA 1 101:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA— $il—[É].[ŠÁR.RA] writes about the logs that the king had ordered him to have towed SAA 1 102:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR writes about carpen-ters who have claimed that the king ordered them to go to Sapirrutu to work instead SAA 1 96:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA writes that he needs his boat, which is currently anchored at Bab-bitqi, in order to bring straw and fodder over at Opis; he suggests that the governor of Arrapha’s boat, which is doing ferry service at Opis, should be sent to Bab-bitqi instead, where the men of the governor of Arrapha are already doing the ferrying SAA 1 94:2 (not dated); mDÙG.G[A—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA] writes to the king about work on the boats which, despite the king’s complaints to the contrary, have actually been completed SAA 1 80:2 (not dated). 
Two letters concern a plague of locusts: [mDÙG. GA—$il—É].[ŠÁR.RA] writes that he had already given the command in the cities and villages to destroy the locusts, even before receiving the king’s order SAA 1 103:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA— $il—É.ŠÁR.RA writes in a poorly preserved letter found in Kalhu that the locusts are now in the centre of the land SAA 1 104:2 (not dated). 
In a fragmentary letter mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR 0! informs the king that the harvest in Hindanu is finished SAA 1 83:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il— [É].ŠÁR 0! complains that he now has to repair the palace in the city of Ekallate because the king exempted the Inner City of Assur from ilku-duty with the result that he himself has to make good the deficit. He also informs the king about 370 men, out of whom 190 are available to do corvee labour SAA 1 99:1 (not dated); m[DÙG.GA—$il— É.ŠÁR.RA] informs the king that a certain canal inspector is going to the king, having passed through Assur SAA 1 89:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA— $il—É.ŠÁR.RA complains that he has not received a replacement for an estate in the city of Qurani in Halahhu province which the king presented to the Nabû Temple in Dur-Šarrukin. At the time when he made this grant, the king ordered that the gov-ernor of Assur be given a village in return, but this has not yet been done and now, for a second year, the author is unable to cultivate the king’s arable fields SAA 1 106:2 (not dated). 
2′. Political matters: mDÙG.GA—GIŠ.MI—É.ŠÁR.RA responds to a message of the king informing him that the chief eunuch is going to Kar-Šamaš; he advises that the chief eunuch should come to Assur instead because the road through the province of Arrapha is arduous. He asks the king to send him 50 of the 100 Itu’ean troops who are keeping watch in \ibtu, so that they can keep watch over the carpenters until he returns SAA 1 97:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA replies to a query of the king concerning the treaty tablet of Gurdî, saying that the adjutant of the palace supervisor came and picked it up on the 1st day of Abu (v.).

After the ceremonies, the messenger of the palace superintendent returned the tablet, as he had been instructed SAA 1 76:2 (not dated); mDÙG.[GA—$il— É.ŠÁR.RA] responds to the king’s command to go to Hinzanu and let the Arabs graze their sheep and camels there, along the banks of the Tharthar river as far as the land of Suhu. He writes that he will go to Hinzanu, but that he doesn’t think the Arabs will remain within the territory assigned to them; he suggests that the governor of Kalhu should appoint a eunuch to oversee the Arabs, but that he himself should retain responsibility for assigning a terri-tory to them SAA 1 82:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA— $il—É.ŠÁR.RA informs the king that the legate of Birat entered Assur on the 7th. When he asked the legate why he had come, the legate replied that he had received a royal message asking him why he had not come when all the other city rulers had come, and also asking why he had not protected Sippar from Arab incursions; on receiving this message the legate was afraid and came SAA 1 84:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA replies to the king’s order telling him to set out on 22nd and reach the Inner City (Assur) on 29th; he wishes to see the king first, before he goes to Assur. He also confirms that he has sent orders concerning the reserves of the king’s men of the Ruqahu and Hatallu tribes, as the king had told him to do SAA 1 91:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.[ŠÁR.RA] writes that he has moved his Itu’eans to the other bank of the river to stand guard in the town of Sinnu. He also complains that he is short of equipped men, and the work is hard; further details are lost but the passage may concern the cutting of timber SAA 1 93:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA informs the king that he is sending him a courier who has just returned from the ruler of Birat with a letter, having been detained there for twelve days SAA 1 85:2 (not dated); [mDÙG.G]A—$il—[É].[ŠÁR.RA] writes that a messenger of the commandant of Borsippa came to Birat, whence he was escorted to Hinzanu and then to Assur SAA 1 87:2 (not dated); mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR 0! informs the king that a messenger of his whom he send to the land Birat with cavalry on the king’s orders was captured; he was then apparently ransomed in the city of Munu’, and now the sender is sending silver (to pay the ransom money) SAA 1 90:2 (not dated); in re-sponse to the king’s query as to how he feeds his horses when he is at home, mDÙG.GA—$il—É.[ŠÁR. RA] explains that half are fed in Barhalza province, the other half in [...] (remaining details broken/lost) SAA 1 107:2 (not dated). 
3′. Cultic matters: mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA writes to the king about the making of the stands for two bronze panthers(?), and about the wood store for the iron brazier in the palace of the Inner City which is to be restored SAA 1 77:2 (not dated); see Dalley (1990) 259-262; mDÙG.[GA—GIŠ].MI—É.ŠÁR. [RA] writes about the placing of a panther(?) in a temple, its feet being turned towards the throne of Lord-of-the-Crown, and about work on the ziggu-rat SAA 1 78:2 (not dated); [mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR. RA] informs the king that a son and a nephew of a deceased household manager of the Aššur Temple are on their way to him, along with a third man, so that the king may appoint one of them to fill the dead man’s position SAA 1 75:2 (not dated). 
4′. Unclear: mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR.RA is the author of a small fragment of a letter mentioning Šarru-emuranni, Šarru-nuri and Babylon SAA 1 88:2 (not dated); another letter of mDÙG.GA—$il—É.ŠÁR 0! has only the greeting formula preserved SAA 1 109:2 (not dated).

5′. Dating the colophon of a literary tablet from Huzirina: mDÙG.GA—IM!—[aš-šur] IGI.DUB GAL Hunger (1968) 363:5 = STT 36. In their catalogue the editors (Gurney -Finkelstein [1957] 3) read the name %ab-$il-Adad, which is consistent with the traces on the copy ([m]DÙG.GA—GIŠ.[MI]—[x x IGI]. [DUB] GAL); however, the presence of the title masennu rabiu indicates that the eponym in ques-tion has to be %ab-šar-Aššur as there is no other holder of that office (cf. Mattila [2000] 13) whose name in any way resembles the traces. 
b. In a votive inscription from Assur: A small alabaster box bears an inscription of mDÙG—[IM]— aš-šur LÚ.IG[I.DUB] dedicating it to his god Adad for the sake of his own life Ass. 14703:3; see Schwemer (2001) 607f (noting that there is no room left in the break after IGI.DUB for the sign(s) GAL(-u), therefore the inscription must have been written before %ab-šar-Aššur was made chief treas-urer). 
c. In the account of Sargon’s 8th campaign: At the end of Sargon’s account of his 8th campaign to Urar#u, before the “signature” of the scribe Nabû-šallimšunu, it is stated that “the best orator” mDÙG. GA—IM—da-šur LÚ.IGI.DUB GAL-ú “brought (the tab-let) to Aššur, my lord” TCL 3 iv 27. This indicates that T. still held office as masennu rabiu in 714, when the account was written.€ Mattila (2000) 15. 
d. In the royal correspondence: mDÙG—IM—aš-šur writes to the king about transporting by boat some stone steps, thresholds and bull colossi (for Dur-Šarrukin). As the boatmen are refusing to use some of the available boats, he is having to organise the work himself using the remaining boats SAA 1 56:2 (not dated); mDÙG—IM—aš-šur writes that after leaving the palace he has stayed overnight in Ubasê and is likely to reach Assur by boat on the follow-ing day, when he will bring some golden [...] into the Aššur Temple; he also writes about a ritual involving a bed which he proposes should be brought into the Aššur Temple so that they might perform their rites together. The bed will enter the house of the treasurer of the Aššur Temple, where the gods of Dur-Šarrukin are also staying. In the meantime, the bed is on the boat and the author of the letter will guard it there overnight SAA 1 54:2 (not dated); mDÙG—IM—aš-[šur] responds to an order of the king that he should ask the chief scribe about work on the ziggurat of Anu. He says that the chief scribe has now been asked, but the report of his reply is broken.

*Uakirtu (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-a-ki-ir-tu. In contrast to Tallqvist (1918) 291a (s.v. 
*kirti), who rightly kept this name separate from Makirtu (written mma-ki-ir-tu in the same line of text!), D′jakonov (1956) 215 fn. (cf. Diakonoff [1970] 111 n. 37; Grantovskij [1962] 252; [1970] 81, 318) equated both these names and understood them as rendering OIran. Vahuk=ta-“created by the Good one(?)”. However, neither this form nor the one conjectured by Markwart (1930) 12 (OIran. 
“*Vai-krta-”, which should in fact be Vayu-k=ta-“made by the Wind-god”) matches the NA rende-ring precisely enough, even apart from the ono-mastic-semasiological objections. The alternative proposal of Hinz (1975) 138 (OIran. Hua-k=ta-∩
“well-made, created well”) is not really better, since hua-“well” is extremely doubtful. Thus ∩
only the second element OIran. -k=ta-“made, created” seems to be certain, unless one prefers (with Schmitt [2009] 159f) OIran. Hu∩-ak=ti-“of lovely figure”. 
Ruler of the city Nappi in the land of Parsuaš (reign of Sargon II): mú-a-ki-ir-tu ša URU.na-ap-pi is one of the rulers of the land of Parsuaš who gave tribute of horses and livestock to Sargon during his eighth campaign in 714 TCL 3:44.

*Uaksatar (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-ak-sa-tar, mú-ak-sa-ta-[ar], muk-sa-tar, mu-ma-ak-[sa-tar]. This name has been understood as the Median equivalent of Cyaxares’s name OPers. u-v-x-š-t-r-/Uvaxštra-/ (cf. Mayrhofer [1979a] 27 no. 51; Werba [1982] 216-219; see also Elam. Ma-ak-iš-tar-ra etc., LB Ú-ma-ku-iš-tar, whereas Gk. Kuax£rhj and Lyc. Wessere-, Waare slightly different hypocor. formations). The propo-sal was first made by Hüsing (1899) 139f (see also, inter alia, Hüsing [1900] 564; Meyer [1909] 8; Tallqvist [1918] XXIV, 238ab; König [1934] 24f, 57; Grantovskij [1962] 254; [1970] 316; Nagel [1982] 104, 149; Ivantchik [1993] 83). The under-lying Iranian name cannot be etymologized with certainty (see Mayrhofer, loc. cit.), but sometimes untenable conclusions regarding its form and/or meaning have been drawn from the NA attesta-tions, e.g. by König (1934) 57 (*Hu∩a-xšat(a)ra-); Diakonoff (1970) 111 n. 37 and Zadok (1976e) 388 n. 14 (*Huxšara-, against which cf. Grantovskij [1970] 316; Hinz [1975] 138; Zadok [1997f] 7). In any case, it is certain that there is no connection with the Iran. comparative suffix -tara-as sup-posed by Tallqvist (1918) 312a. See now Schmitt (2009) 160-2.
1. Ruler of the city Qarkinšera in Media (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): m[uk]-sa-tar šá URU.qar-[kin]-še-ra is one of the Median rulers who bring tribute of horses to Tiglath-pileser in 737, during his second Median campaign; he brings 100 horses Tadmor (1994) St.2B:33; possibly identical with 2. 
2. City-lord of the land Nartu (reign of Sargon II): In 714 muk-sa-tar, Duresi and Satarešu, city-lords of Nartu in western Iran, are among those who bring tribute to Sargon TCL 3:42. In a letter to the king, Mannu-ki-Ninua writes that Uppite, city-lord of Uriakka, has fled to Šaparda. The king’s servant Nabû-taqqinanni heard about it, and he and mú-ak-sa-tar had him captured along with four sons of his SAA 15 101 r. 6 (not dated); in another letter [mu-ma-ak]-[sa-tar] is mentioned in a broken context SAA 15 110 r. 4 (not dated);€ Fuchs -Parpola (2001) xxviif (on the background), xlii (for a proposed date in 706 for SAA 15 101); they assume that he is identical with 1. 
3. Father of a son (reign of Esarhaddon): In a letter to the king, (crown prince) Assurbanipal reports on the Cimmerians of Iyazê; a son (name lost) of mú-ak-sa-t[a-ar] is mentioned in a broken context SAA 16 15:20 (not dated, but the edition suggests 672-669).

*Uallî (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-al-li-i. While Justi (1895b) 346b included this name in his onomasticon (without good rea-son), Tallqvist (1918) XXIII rightly surmised that it is not Iranian but is more likely of Hurr. or Urar#. origin. Cf. Schmitt (2009) 162. 
Mannean ruler, son of his predecessor Ahšeri (reign of Assurbanipal): When the Mannean ruler Ahšeri was murdered by his own people following an insurrection, mú-al-li-i, his son, sat upon his (father’s) throne and submitted in fear to Assur-banipalPrismAiii11//Biii86//Civ95//Fii 41 = Borger (1996) 35, 221; mú-al-[li]-[i] IIT:88 = Fuchs (1996) 276.

*Uarbisi (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-a-ar-bi-is, mú-ar-bi-is, [mú-ar-bi]-si, mú-bar-bi-si; also mú-a-ár-me-ri (clearly the same individual). The latter spelling exhibits rhotacism (s > r) and has NA <rm> for foreign /rw/, cf. Ar-ma-da and Ar-ú-a-da etc. (Bagg [2007] 27ff) for Phœn. ’rwd (modern ar-Rwad). It seems that NA <b>, extant in the signs BI and BAR of the more common spellings, renders foreign /w/ (ap-proximately Warwis > Warwir). The name is definitely non-Semitic. The phenomenon of rhota-cism (in this case originating from a sibilant) is confined to certain dialects, but the specific lin-guistic affiliation of this name eludes us. 
1. Official in charge of a conquered city (reign of Esarhaddon): mú-ar-bi-is is said to have been installed in a certain city (name lost) along with several other individuals whose names are mostly not preserved. Among them Ki$ir-Issar can be identified as holding the (renamed) town Ša-emuq-Aššur. The background is most likely Esarhad-don’s Egyptian campaign during which he re-named the conquered cities and installed officials to govern them (see Pritchard [1969] 293f) RINAP 4 9 ii′10. 
2. (Great) “third man” (on a chariot) from Nine-veh (late reign of Esarhaddon and reign of Assur-banipal): Uarbisi belongs to the circle of Assur-banipal’s charioteer Remanni-Adad in whose ta-blets he frequently features as a witness. The unique designation “great third man” (tašlišu dannu, SAA 6 335 r. 14) implies a promotion, though if so its timing remains unknown as the date of the document is lost: [mú-ar-bi-si LÚ*.:] (for [LÚ.3-šú] in the preceding line) acts as a witness for Remanni-Adad who buys a baker SAA 6 305 r. 7 (669); [mú-ar-bi]-si LÚ.: (for [L]Ú.3-šú in the preceding line) in the duplicate SAA 6 306 r. 6 (date lost); [m][ú]-a-ar-bi-is [LÚ.3.U5!] acts as a wit-ness for Remanni-Adad who buys a man SAA 6 310 r. 4 (667); mú-a-ár-me-ri LÚ*.:. (for LÚ*.3-si-šú in the preceding line) acts as a witness for Reman-ni-Adad who lends ten minas of silver, seventy-five rams and one heifer to several men SAA 6 323 r. 3 (664); mú-bar-[bi!-si!] LÚ*.:. (for LÚ*.3.U5 in the preceding line) acts as a witness for Remanni-Adad who buys the town Dannaia SAA 6 325 r. 11′(663); [mú-ar]-[bi]-is LÚ.3.U5 acts as witness for Remanni-Adad who buys land SAA 6 339 r. 3 (date lost); mú-ar-[bi-is] [LÚ.:.] (for [LÚ.3.U5] in the preceding line) acts as a witness for Remanni-Adad who buys six people together with the town of Musina-aplu-iddina SAA 6 326 r. 15 (date lost); mú-ar-bi-i[s LÚ*.3.U5] acts as witness for Remanni-Adad SAA 6 350 r. 3′(date lost); [mú-a]r-bi-is LÚ.3.[U5] acts as witness for Remanni-Adad who buys ten people SAA 6 342 r. 5 (date lost); mú-bar-bi-si 3-si-šú [dan]-nu acts as a witness for Reman-ni-Adad who buys property near Qatna SAA 6 335 r. 14 (date lost).€ Fales (1987). 
3. Chief judge active in Dur-Katlimmu/Magdalu (reign of Assurbanipal): mú-ar-bi-is LÚ.sar-ten // mú-ar-bi-is LÚ.sar-(ten)-nu and the grand vizier Aššur-ila’i pronounce a judgement upon the cha-riot owner Rahimi-il who is to bring the shepherd Apladad-ila’i to testify; if he fails to do so he is to pay sheep, their offspring and wool as well as eight people together with their fines to Nergal-šarru-u$ur BATSH 6 110:1 and the envelope BATSH 6 110*:2 (656).

*Uardatti (“Given by the Sun-god”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-ar-da-at-ti. This name renders OIran. Hu∩ar-data-“given by the Sun-god” (cf. Mayrhofer [1974] 77 no. 146). The name is also reflected by Elam. Ú-mar-da-(ad-)da, LB Ú-mar-da-(a-)tu etc. and has its equivalent in Proto Indo-Aryan Šuu∩ardata (cf. Mayrhofer [1973] 245 no. 8.1718; Hinz [1975] 130). The alternative interpre-tation by Hinz (1975) 270, who reconstructed OIran. V=data-(supposed to be enlarged upon v=da-“rose”) is both unnecessary and unfounded. All of these possibilities have to be excluded if one is willing to accept the identification with Barda-da proposed by A. Fuchs (PNA 1/II 270). The problems concerning both of these names and their interpretation are discussed in detail by Schmitt (2009) 61-4.
Ruler of the town \ibaru in Media (reign of Sargon II): In an account of Sargon’s sixth cam-paign, mú-ar-da-at-t[i (x)] [URU.$i]-bar-a-[a] is mentioned in a broken context as not having sub-mitted to the king’s predecessors Najafehabad ii 65 = Levine (1972) 44; note that it has been suggested that he is to be identified with Bardada. 
<<H. Baker >>.
*Uargi (“Of good value”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-ar-gi. This name, as well as the anthroponym underlying the toponym Bit-U(m)argi, cannot re-flect OIran. Hu-marga-“with nice meadows” (as assumed by Grantovskij [1970] 312f; Grantovskij [1971] 303; Hinz [1975] 125 s.v. humrga). Rather, it must reflect something like OIran. Hu∩arga-(cf. Zadok [1976a] 214b); this may be interpreted as OIran. Hu-arga-“of good value (or similar)” with Iran. arga-(= OIA arghá-“value, price”) and should not be identified with Ved. svargá-“heavenly” nor with Elam. Mar-ka (cf. Mayrhofer [1973] 191 no. 8.979). See also Schmitt (2009) 163. 
Military official(?) (probably reign of Tiglath-pileser III): In a letter to the king, Nergal-ašared mentions that when mú-ar-gi came, some people had incurred 370 casualties ND 2701 r. 4 = NL 77 = CTN 5 141f (not dated).

*Uarkaza (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-ar-ka-za. Zadok (1986) 247 suggests both Hurrian and Iranian derivations, considering on the one hand the name elements Hurr. war-and -kazzi, on the other hand OIran. Varkaza-as pa-tronymic to V=kaza-“driving wolves”. However, this all remains theoretical; cf. also Schmitt (2009) 164f.
Cohort commander from Arzuhina, active in Kalhu (reign of Sargon II): In a horse list mú-ar-[k]a-za has five equids in his care out of a total of forty-five assigned to the cohort commanders from Arzuhina CTN 3 102 iii 4 (not dated or date lost, but Dalley -Postgate [1984] 194 assign a date of c. 711). 
<<H. Baker >>.
*Uaru (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-a-ru, mú-a-ri. While Johns (1901) 163 con-sidered an Aramaic origin, Tallqvist (1918) 281a referred to Anatolian names such as Oarij. How-ever, the brevity of the name makes it possible also to consider Iranian etymologies, e.g. OIran. Vara-(= YAv. proper name Vara-; see Mayrhofer [1977] 91 no. 353) or Vari-(based on names in Av. -uuari-“breastplate”) or Varu-(based on those beginning with Iran. varu-“wide, broad”). Out of these possibilities the former is distinctly possible, although neither its applicability nor its interpretation can be proven. See Schmitt (2009) 165. 
1. Fugitive (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): In a letter to the king, Qurdi-Aššur-lamur (governor of \imirra?) says that he has sent four fugitives, in-cluding mú-a-ru, to the king NL 98:7 = ND 2477 = CTN 5 272 (not dated).

*Uarzan (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-ar-za-an. This name of a Median city-lord has long been recognized as Iran.: whereas Justi (1895b) 523 tentatively listed it among the formations in Iran. -ana-, other scholars (e.g. Rost [1897] 113 n. 1; Streck [1900] 357; Tallqvist [1918] XXIV, 238b, 281a, etc.) identified it with Y Av. var!zana-“member of the community (not: protégé)”, which Justi (1895b) 517 had erroneously listed as the second element of names like Gk. 'Ariobarz£nhj, Miqrobarz£nhj etc., and with Gk. Barz£nhj, all of which however contain OIran. -b=zana-“making big, letting grow,” as is shown by Parth. -brzn. On the other hand Eilers (1940b) 218f added LB Ú-mar-za-na-’, Ú-mar-za-nu. More likely than a re-lation to OAv. v!r!z&na-, YAv. var!zana-etc. (not attested in personal names though) is the etymo-logy considered first by Grantovskij (1970) 298f, who traced the name back to OIran. Varz-ana-and to the root OIran. (Med.) varz “to do, bring about, etc.”. But since in this case the LB forms should reflect OPers. vard (as in a-r-t-v-r-di-i-y-/Bta-vardiya-/), Hinz (1975) 130 sought an alter-native, OIran. Hu∩ar-canah-“yearning for the Sun(-god)”. The question must be left open. Ever since Hüsing (1897) 29 and Rost (1897) 113 n. 1 this name has often been seen in relation to Urza-na, most recently by Grantovskij (1970) 298ff; Grantovskij (1998) 29f. However, the strict dif-ferentiation, both in formal and prosopographical terms, argue against this identification. Cf. also Schmitt (2009) 165-7. 
Ruler of the land Uqutti in Media (reign of Sar-gon II): mú-ar-za-an [ša] KUR.ú-qu-ut-ti is one of the Median rulers who bring tribute to Sargon in 713 Fuchs (1998) VI.b:19.

*Uitana (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-i-ta-na. Zadok (1986) 247 assumed OIran. Vi-tana-as a possible source and compared the root Ved. vi-tan “to spread out, extend etc.” However, with-out any onomastic support this remains doubtful and one may look for alternatives (e.g. V-i/ai-t/a:na-).

Judging by their names, the men in this sec-tion seem likely to be of Babylonian extraction. The use of the tripartite genealogy in this instance (and its Babylonian mode of expression: DUMU-šú ša followed by DUMU) suggests that Ukkaiu may be the ancestral name of Munnabitu rather than that of his grandfather SAA 11 26 l.e. 1 (not dated).

*Ulkâ (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mul-ka-a. Contrary to Tallqvist (1918) 239b, 267b, Zadok (1997a) 213 n. 5 considered (although apparently without compelling reason) an Iran. origin (OIran. V=ka-“wolf” [as also in Elam. Mar-qa, NPers. Gurg], from an -l-dialect, how-ever). This is rather unlikely; cf. Schmitt (2009) 169. R. Zadok notes that an Urar#. origin is possible in view of the occurrence of the same name, Ul-ka-a (of) KUR.ar-ma (an abbreviated form of Armarili?), in a recently published Urar#ian document dated c. 673 or later (Salvini [2001] 284, CB A Y -11).

2. Landowner(?) in the vicinity of Kalhu (reign of Aššur-nerari V): [mul?-l]u-ba-a-a is named, probably as a neighbouring landowner, in a docu-ment recording the purchase of land by Mannu-ki-mat-Aššur CTN 2 23:5 (754); possibly identical with 1. 
3. Official active in Babylonia (reign of Sargon II): In a poorly preserved letter to the king, mul-lu-b[a-a-a] denies that he has been involved in selling Sinneans for silver, contrary to what has been reported to the king SAA 17 165:1 (not dated); another letter may also be attributed to Ullubaiu as it concerns the same subject matter SAA 17 166. There is no evidence in support of the claim by Dietrich (2003) 145 that this Ullubaiu “seems to have conspired with Merodach-Baladan during the conquestion of Southern Babylonia”.

This name was erroneously listed among Iran. names by Justi (1895b) 333b. It was declared by Tallqvist (1918) XXIII to be Urar#., and (less specifically) by Herz-feld (1938) 164 (comparing Erisinni) to be in-digenous. See now Schmitt (2009) 169f. Cf. Šulu-sunu.

After Azâ’s death in battle, mul-lu-s[u]-nu!, his brother, who had occupied the royal throne, incurred the rage of Aššur and placed his trust in Rusâ the Urar#ian and also gained Aššur-le’i of Karalla and Itti of Allabria as his allies against Sargon Fuchs (1994) Ann.83; a variant refers to mul-[lu]-su-nu who occupied the throne of Azâ and to whom the entire land of Mannea submitted Fuchs (1994) Ann.83a; this mul-lu-su-nu KUR.[man]-na-a-[a] in-curred the rage of Aššur and (finally) caused his land to be broken up Fuchs (1994) Ann.83b. Sar-gon campaigned against Mannea but once he had subdued the entire land he took pity on them and forgave the crimes of [mul]-lu-[su]-nu and rein-stalled him on his royal throne and received tribute from him Fuchs (1994) Ann.88. Later, in Sargon’s seventh regnal year (715), Rusâ the Urar#ian spoke lies to mul-lu-su-nu KUR.man-na-a-a and took away twenty-two of his fortresses Fuchs (1994) Ann. 101; he also incited the Mannean governor Daiukku to rebel against mul-lu-su-nu, taking Daiukku’ s son as hostage Fuchs (1994) A nn.102; Sargon seized the twenty-two fortresses for Assy-ria, and deported Daiukku and his family. During the Urar#ian campaign of Sargon’s eighth regnal year (714), the Assyrian king conquered Wišdiš, a district of Mannea, and gave it to mul-lu-su-nu KUR.man-na-a-a Fuchs (1994) Ann.137. In his ninth regnal year, Sargon received tribute from [m]ul-lu-su-nu KUR.ma-an-na-a-a as well as from Daltâ of Ellipi, Bel-aplu-iddina of Allabria and forty-five Median city lords Fuchs (1994) Ann.191. 
Another account tells how Rusâ won over the Mannean governors with lies and threw the corpse of Azâ, son of their lord, on Mt. Wauš; mul-lu-su-nu KUR.man-na-a-a, who had occupied his father’ s throne, placed his trust in Rusâ the Urar#ian and gave him twenty-two fortresses as a gift Fuchs (1994) Prunk.38. When Sargon mounted his cam-paign, mul-lu-su-nu KUR.man-na-a-a saw his ap-proach, left his city and made his base in the mountains Fuchs (1994) Prunk.40; Sargon in-flicted a defeat upon the Urar#ian Rusâ, conquering his towns and taking away the twenty-two for-tresses which had belonged to mul-lu-su-nu KUR. man-na-a-a Fuchs (1994) Prunk.44; mul-lu-su-nu KUR.man-na-a-a heard of Sargon’ s actions while in the mountains and came and submitted to Sar-gon, who pardoned his numerous crimes and rein-stalled him on his royal throne Fuchs (1994) Prunk.50. 
In the “letter to Aššur” comprising an account of Sargon’s eighth campaign, mul-lu-su-nu KUR.ma-an-na-a-a heard of the king’s advance and, together with all his nobles and magnates, left his royal city Izirtu and came to the mountain fortress Sinihini bringing tribute of horses and livestock and kissed Sargon’s feet TCL 3:32. Later on, Sar-gon set out from the land Parsuaš and approached the land of Missi, a district of Mannea; mul-lu-su-nu and the people of his land in loyal subservience sought out the king’s campaign in the fortress town Sirdakka TCL 3:52. Following the defeat of Rusâ, Sargon restored the scattered land of Mannea. He established before their lord mul-lu-su-nu LUGAL a ceremonial table and elevated his throne above that of Iranzi, his progenitor TCL 3:62. Later on in the same account Mitatti, ruler of Zikirtu, is portrayed as a rebellious subject of mul-lu-su-nu LUGAL, his lord TCL 3:80. Sargon refers to his having driven the wicked enemy out of Mannea and gladdened the heart of mul-lu-su-nu, their (the Manneans’) lord TCL 3:155. 
A fragment of a tablet records that in Sargon’s fifth (= sixth) regnal year, mul-[lu]-[su-nu] ... (re-mainder lost) Fuchs (1998) IIb.15. The broken passage probably parallels the stele from Iran which records that in Sargon’s sixth regnal year, mul-lu-su-nu? KUR.man-na-a-a? set in motion the scattering of his land and the destruction of his people, placing his trust in Rusâ the Urar#ian ruler Najafehabad ii 22 = Levine (1972) 36f. According to a prism fragment, Sargon installed [mul-lu-su-nu] over the land of Mannea and imposed upon him tribute like that imposed upon his father Iranzi Fuchs (1998) IId.8. In Sargon’s sixth regnal year (716) Rusâ the Urar#ian took away by force twelve (other accounts: twenty-two) fortified strongholds of mul-lu-su-ni KUR.ma-an-na-a-a, who had sub-mitted to Sargon during a previous campaign Fuchs (1998) IIIe.14; to avenge mul-lu-[su-ni] KUR.ma-an-na-a-a Sargon assembled his forces and set out to (re)conquer those fortresses Fuchs (1998) IIIe.21; he succeeded in conquering them, looting them and bringing inside his troops and those of mul-lu-su-[ni] KUR.ma-an-na-a-a Fuchs (1994) IIIe.24. Finally, [mul?-lu?]-su-nu may be re-stored in a fragmentary inscription KAL 3 31:4′.€ Fuchs (1998) 83 (on the chronology of Sargon’s campaigns). 
b. In the royal correspondence: In a fragmentary letter the sender reports that Nabû-hamatu’a wrote to him saying that Aššur-le’i is going to mú-li-su-ni and that mú-li-su-nu has given five horses to Aššur-le’i. The sender has forwarded Nabû-hamatu’a’ s report on the horses to Nineveh SAA 5 218:8, 9 (not dated); another fragmentary letter mentions mul-su-[un]-n[u] in a broken context SAA 5 220:4 (not dated); mul-lu-su-[nu] // mul-l[u-su-nu] is men-
tioned twice in a small fragment of letter SAA 1 9:2, r. 2 (not dated).

1. Governor of Kalzi and eponym of the year 832 (reign of Shalmaneser III): This official is known from three copies of the Eponym List and two copies of the Eponym Chronicle: mI[TI.KIN-a-a] // mITI.KIN-a-[a] // mITI.K[IN-a-a] Eponym List 832 (A1 ii 31, A2 ii 21′, A8 ii 24); [mITI.KIN-a-a GAR.

2. Subordinate of the commander-in-chief, from Assur (reign of Aššur-dan III): mITI.KIN-a-a ša É LÚ.tur-ta-[ni] acts as a witness for Marduk-eriba who is also a member of the household of the commander-in-chief StAT 2 234 r. 15 (762). 
3. Birth name of Shalmaneser V, king of Assyria (727-722): a. While this king is known only as Shalmaneser from official Assyrian documents dating to his reign, his other name, Ululaiu, is used in some later documents, an Aramaic letter from the 7th century, and two lists of Babylonian kings compiled in the Chaldean and Ptolemaic periods respectively.€ Brinkman (1968) 62f, 243-245. 
1′. Shalmaneser is attested under the name Ulu-laiu in two lists of Babylonian kings. It is, how-ever, important to note that Ululaiu was not Shal-maneser’s throne name as king of Babylon (Frame [1992] 303f). 
a′. In a list of kings of Babylonia from the early second millennium until the Chaldean dynasty: In the so-called Babylonian King List A mú-lu-la-a-a is mentioned as having ruled for five years; BALA BAL.TIL “dynasty of Assur” is added Grayson (1980) 93 (King List 3 iv 9). 
b′. In the “Ptolemaic Canon”: The first section of the list of kings compiled by Ptolemy of Alex-andria is devoted to the Babylonian kings, and 'Iloulaiou is listed as having ruled for five years Grayson (1980) 101 (King List 8). 
2′. Shalmaneser V is also mentioned as Ululaiu in an Aramaic letter found at Assur, but dealing with Babylonian matters. In it, Bel-e#ir informs Pir’-Amurru that a message from the king of Bab-ylon (i.e., Šamaš-šumu-ukin) to the tribe of Bit-Amukani has been captured; Bel-e#ir reminds Pir’-Amurru that the Assyrian kings Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, ’lly (i.e., Shalmaneser V) and Sennache-rib had previously had various Babylonian popula-tion groups deported and recommends similiar ac-tions against Bit-Amukani in retaliation for its treachery; the events take place during the bro-thers’ war between Assurbanipal and Šamaš-šumu-ukin, and both Bel-e#ir and Pir’-Amurru are Assyrian military officials active in Babylonia Hug (1993) AssB:15 (not dated, but c. 650).€ Donner -Röllig (1973) 287-291. 
b. It was first suggested by Brinkman (1968) 244 n. 1564 that a high Assyrian official active in the north-western part of Assyria during the reign of Tiglath-pileser III, whose correspondence with the king is known, should be identified with Ululaiu, then the crown prince of Assyria, as his letters all contain a characteristic greeting formula which is otherwise typical for the letters of the crown prince Sennacherib to his father Sargon II (SAA 1 29, 31-38, SAA 5 281): “Assyria is well, the temples are well, all the forts of the king are well. The king, my lord, can be very glad.” From his letters to the king, it can be gathered that Ululaiu’s area of activity was in the region of Til-Barsib and Guzana, as travellers passing through these cities needed his authorization. His duties also included the collection of ice and its delivery by river transport, which is compatible with a posting in the aforementioned area: mITI.KIN-a-a reports to the king that the emissaries of Ku-muhhu, Carchemish, Marqasa, Sam’al, Ashdod and Moab have travelled through Til-Barsip and Guzana without his authorization; they have now been detained in Kubana(še) NL 50:2 = ND 2762 = CTN 5 182ff (not dated); m[ITI].KIN-a-a informs the king that he has sent thirty-six loads of ice by raft to the king under the supervision of the body-guard Ubru-Nergal NL 31:2 = ND 2792 = CTN 5 204f (not dated); mITI.KIN-a-[a] informs the king that he collected a total of ninety loads of ice from the commander-in-chief, the chief cupbearer and another official; the reed has been sent on to the king by means of rafts NL 51:2 = ND 2409 = CTN 5 195f = Radner (2003/4) no. 3 (not dated); in another letter to the king, m[ITI.KI]N-a-a has noth-ing to report but that everything is well NL 53:2 = ND 2372 = CTN 5 194 (not dated).€ Radner (2003/4). 
4. Owner of land in Maganubba (reign of Sargon II): When Nabû-kabti-ahhešu, the palace scribe of Sargon, buys property in Maganubba, the site of Sargon’s future residence city Dur-Šarrukin, he acquires land belonging to [m]IT[I!.K]IN!-a!-a and Ilu-ereš SAA 6 31:16; mITI.[KI]N!-a-a (mITI.KI[N-a-a] in l. 23) is also twice mentioned as the owner of property adjoining fields bought by Nabû-kabti-ahhešu SAA 6 31:12, 23 (709).€ Radner (1997c) 19-23, 28f.

Elamite who revolted against king Ummanal-dašu III (reign of Assurbanipal): After the Elamite king Ummanaldašu had abandoned his city Madak-tu and fled to “his mountain” upon hearing that Assurbanipal’s troops had entered Elam, mum-ba-HAB-u-a, who had left Elam and fled to the city Bubilu, occupied the throne in opposition to Um-manaldašu; however, he too heard (of the Assy-rians’ approach) and abandoned Bubilu, the seat of his lordship, and took to the deep, distant waters like a fish.

Prominent Elamite, supporter of the anti-Assy-rian rebel Nabû-bel-šumati (reign of Assurbani-pal): A letter from Bel-ibni of the Sealand to As-surbanipal mentions [m]um-hu-lu-ma-a’ in a broken context together with Nabû-bel-šumati who is to be seized as soon as possible ABL 462 r. 3′= de Vaan (1995) 261-5 (not dated); in another letter Bel-ibni reports that mum-h[u-lu-ma-a’] sent his herald to various cities but the herald was killed ABL 1311+:6 = de Vaan (1995) 311-17 (not dated). A third letter of Bel-ibni to Assurbanipal was apparently written after the death of Umhulu-ma’.

1. Ummanaldašu I, king of Elam 689-681 (reign of Sennacherib): According to the Babylonian Chronicle, hum-ba-hal-da-šú ascended the throne. His relationship (if any) to his predecessor Menanu (Ummanmenanu, Humban-nimena) is unknown Grayson (1975) 81 iii 27. The subsequent passage (iii 28f) then notes that the gods of Uruk returned to Uruk from a place that is broken away. Grayson restores “[Ela]m,” while Glassner (1993) 183 re-stores “[Assy]rie(!)”. Only the last vertical wedge before KI is extant (collation E. Leichty), so the reading is not decisive. The Chronicle also records (iii 30f) that Ummanaldašu died in the evening of the 23rd day of Tašritu (vii.) after becoming par-alysed at the noon-hour; he had ruled Elam for eight years. This Ummanaldašu has previously been considered to be the father of his successor Ummanaldašu II; however, following collation of the relevant passage in the Babylonian Chronicle it now appears that they were rather brothers (see the following entry for further details).€ Waters (2000) 36f. 
2. Ummanaldašu II, king of Elam 681-675, brother of Ummanaldašu I, Urtaku, Teumman and possibly also Ummanigaš, father of Kudurru and Parrû, possibly grandfather of Ummanamni (reigns of Sennacherib and Esarhaddon and [posthumous-ly] reign of Assurbanipal): a. As king of Elam: According to the Babylonian Chronicle, hum-ba-hal-da-šú the second, his (i.e. Ummanaldašu I’s) [...], ascended the throne Gray-son (1975) 81 iii 33. The sign which describes his relationship to his predecessor is broken; Grayson and Glassner (1993) 183 both restore “son” ([mar(?)]-šú, and Grayson (1975) 81 comments: “There is no evidence for this restoration but it is the only plausible one.” However, collation (court-esy E. Leichty) has revealed that the traces of the sign favour a restoration ŠEŠ “brother”, which would indicate that Ummanaldašu I, Ummanaldašu II, Urtaku and Teumman all were brothers; see Waters (2006). In addition, the tablet K 2867+ r. 1 confirms that Ummanaldašu II, Urtaku and Teum-man were brothers; see Streck (1916) 212f and Borger (1996) 330f. 
Ummanaldašu was active in Babylonian affairs. According to the Babylonian Chronicle the king of Elam was responsible for the assassination of Nabû-zer-kitti-lišir, governor of the Sealand, who had sought refuge in Elam after attacking Ur in 681 (see Grayson [1975] 82 iii 40ff). In 675 the king of Elam attacked Sippar but with no apparent long-term effects (Grayson [1975] 83 iv 9f). 
Various letters indicate further Elamite-Assy-rian friction between 681 and 675, although they do not mention Ummanaldašu by name: ABL 576 (from the elders of the Sealand to Esarhaddon), SAA 18 87 (beginning broken) and SAA 18 85 (from Na’ id-Marduk to the queen mother [Naqi’a/Zakutu]) relate his attempts, mediated via Nabû-ušallim and supported by his brother Teum-man, to wrest control of the Sealand from Assyria; see Waters (1999b). The Babylonian Chronicle records that hum-ba-hal-da-šú died in his palace “without becoming ill” (NU GIG) and was suc-ceeded by Urtaku (Grayson [1975] 84 iv 11). 
b. As the father of Kudurru and Parrû: After Teumman occupied the throne of Urtaku, he sought to kill the sons of Urtaku and the sons of mum-man-al-da-a-še // mum-man-al-da-še (var. mum-man-al-de-še), brother of Urtaku Prism B iv 77 // C v 83 = Borger (1996) 97; m[um]-[man-al-da-še] 66-5-19,1:8′= Borger (1996) 198.

c. A possible reference in a letter of Bel-ibni: In a letter of Bel-ibni to the king [mum-ma-hal]-da-šú is mentioned in a badly broken context. The letter was clearly written during the reign of Tammaritu II since part of it concerns the disposition of Tam-maritu’s troops, therefore if the restoration is cor-rect then it may refer to the former king, Tammari-tu’s uncle ABL 1311+ r. 21 = de Vaan (1995) 311-317 (not dated); see Waters (2000) 74. 
3. Ummanaldašu III, king of Elam 648?-645?, son of Atta-metu, brother of Sikdê (reign of Assur-banipal): a. In the inscriptions of Assurbanipal: Ummanal-dašu is known as the son of Atta-metu (Elam. Atta-hamiti-Inšušinak), who may or may not be identical with the homonymous commander of ar-chers under Ummanigaš II or with the Atta-hami-ti-Inšušinak whose inscribed stele was found at Susa (König [1965] nos. 86-89; Stolper apud Har-per et al.

Following the overthrow of Indabibi in 648(?), m[um]-[man-al-da-si] // [mum-man-a]l-da-si // [mum]-man-al-ta-áš son of Atta-metu acceded to the throne of Elam K 2656+:12 = Borger (1996) 156; Prism C ix 85 // H4 iii 5′= Borger (1996) 155, 193. Ummanaldašu’s reign in Elam was intermittent as he faced three Assyrian campaigns and several revolts, the exact chrono-logy of which is uncertain. Assurbanipal’s first campaign against Ummanaldašu began in Simanu (iii.) of 648 or 647: In his fifth (var. seventh) campaign, in the month Simanu (iii.), Assurbani-pal mustered his troops and set out against mum-man-al-da-si (var. mum-man-al-daš, mum-man-al-da-še, mum-man-al-da-a-š[e]) MAN // LUGAL KUR.

Assurbanipal installed Tammaritu as ruler in Susa but subse-quently defeated him after Tammaritu revolted. Assyrian forces plundered several cities along the Babylonian-Elamite frontier and in Susiana before they departed. Ummanaldašu apparently regained his position, since according to Assurbanipal’s in-scriptions the king mounted his sixth (var. eighth) campaign against mum-man-al-da-si MAN KUR.NIM.

The return of the goddess Nanaya to Uruk in Kislimu (ix.) of 647 or 646 after 1635 years in Elam marked the end of the campaign. However, Ummanaldašu survived this campaign: mum-man-al-daš MAN // LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI left his mountain refuge and returned to Madaktu, the city which Assurbanipal had conquered and destroyed Prism A vii 9 = Borger (1996) 59; with the aim of extraditing the rebel Nabû-bel-šumati, grandson of Marduk-apla-iddina II, who had trusted in Ummanigaš, Tam-maritu, Indabibi (and) mum-man-al-daš, kings of Elamite, for support Prism A vii 23 = Borger (1996) 59, Assurbanipal sent his envoy to mum-man-al-daš in anger Prism A vii 27 = Borger (1996) 59; Nabû-bel-šumati heard that the envoy had entered Elam, and he and his groom killed one another with their daggers; mum-man-al-daš was afraid and packed Nabû-bel-šumati’s body in salt and gave it to Assurbanipal’s envoy, along with the head of the groom which he had cut off Prism A vii 38 = Borger (1996) 59. A letter of his dated 26-IV-646* (see below) reports that he had sent the corpse of Nabû-bel-šumati to Assurbanipal packed in salt.

b. In the royal correspondence: There are a num-ber of letters which concern Elamite affairs during the reign of Ummanaldašu, but in general they are difficult to date or to place in any sequence. An exception to this is a letter of mum-man-al-da-si LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI to Assurbanipal, dated 26-IV-646*, which reports on the Elamite king’s cap-ture of Nabû-bel-šumati, an episode also men-tioned in the royal inscriptions (see a.) ABL 879:1 (646*). A number of other letters from the royal correspondence concern the attempts to extradite Nabû-bel-šumati and must therefore have been written before ABL 879; Bel-ibni, governor of the Sealand, was particularly active in this affair: Bel-ibni reports on [mum-ma-hal-d]a-a-šú, the previous king who had fled and then reoccupied his throne but later abandoned Madaktu in fear together with all of his family. When mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú first returned to Madaktu he had criticised his aides for not delivering up Nabû-bel-šumati to Assyria as that would have forestalled the Assyrian king’s actions against them. Bel-ibni proposes that the king have a sealed royal message sent to mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú concerning the capture of Nabû-bel-šumati; he suggests that he himself should have the message brought in secrecy to mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú. Later on in the letter Bel-ibni discusses the plight of the šarnuppu-people, who are suffering from hunger and whose rations have been diverted to Nabû-bel-šumati by his Elamite supporters. He writes that now the šarnuppu-people have seized Nabû-bel-šumati to demand the return of their ra-tions; they have brought him to mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú, and although he (Nabû-bel-šumati) has ap-pealed several times, Ummanaldašu has refused to rescue him ABL 281:5, 23, r. 1, 2, 25 = de Vaan (1995) 243-8 (not dated); for a discussion of this letter see Stolper (1978). Perhaps the same episode (or at least the same general time period) is the subject of another letter of Bel-ibni which men-tions mum-ma-hal-[da-šú] in connection with the supply of bread to some people who are suffering from famine ABL 1010 r. 8 (not dated). Bel-ibni writes again to the king about having a royal mess-enger sent to mum-man-al-da-šú LUGAL with a de-mand for the extradition of Nabû-bel-šumati; he mentions his earlier proposal that he should have a letter conveyed in secrecy to Ummanaldašu. The Elamite king has apparently responded and claims to have brought Nabû-bel-šumati down from the mountains and to be keeping him under guard so that he cannot escape ABL 1286:12′= de Vaan (1995) 307-10 (not dated). In a royal letter ad-dressed to Ambappi and the elders of the land Rašu, Assurbanipal writes of all the favours which he has done for Elam but which the Elamites have not returned; he mentions that he had written to mum-man-al-da-si telling him to deliver up Assur-banipal’ s criminal opponent (Nabû-bel-šumati) ABL 1260 r. 4 (not dated; Waters [2000] 70 n. 14 suggests that the letter was written shortly before Assurbanipal’ s first campaign against Ummanal-dašu III). See Waters (2000) 78f on the attempts to extradite Nabû-bel-šumati. 
Other letters referring to political events in Elam cannot be sequenced with confidence: Bel-ibni re-ports that Ummanigaš son of Amedirra has insti-gated a revolt against mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú, sup-ported by Elamites from the river Hudhud to Hida-lu; mum-ma-hal-da-šú is said to have drawn up his troops on the other side of the river ABL 280 r. 17, 20 (not dated); another letter of Bel-ibni may con-cern the same episode: he reports to the king a revolt of the entire land of Elam against mum-ma-hal-da-a-šú “their king”, who had fled to the mountains in fear ABL 462:17 (not dated); see Waters (2000) 73 and Waters (2002a) for the back-ground to these two letters. A letter of Assurbani-pal lists captured Elamites, including the family of Teumman; it is said that the chief bowman Sikdê, the brother of mum-man-al-da-si, has been killed together with his sons and their heads have been brought to Assurbanipal CT 54 567:5′(not dated). In a letter of Assurbanipal to Tammaritu, [mum-ma]n-al-da-[si] is mentioned in a very broken con-text ABL 1022 r. 5 (not dated). According to a letter to the king from a sender whose name is lost, Lalkidinnu, Arikâ and twelve members of the clan of mum-man-hal-da-šú have captured an unnamed city ABL 478 r. 6 (not dated); the context is ob-scure and it is not certain that the reference is to Ummanaldašu III. 
c. In literary compositions: mum-man-al-da-si is mentioned in a fragment of a composition celebra-ting A ssurbanipal’ s victory over Elam K 3093:12′; [mum]-man-al-d[a-si] is mentioned in another very fragmentary text which also appears to be con-cerned with Assurbanipal’s Elamite wars SAA 3 24:2′(not dated).

2. Son of the Elamite king Urtaku, brother of Ummanigaš (II) and of Tammaritu (I), father of Umbakidini and Ummanamni (reign of Assurbani-pal): Following the death of Urtaku, Teumman ascended the throne of Elam and sought to kill the sons of Urtaku and those of his brother Ummanal-dašu: Ummanigaš, mum-man-ap-pa and Tammari-tu, the sons of Urtaku, king of Elam, and Kudurru and Parrû, the sons of Ummanaldašu, predecessor of Urtaku, and sixty members of the royal house-hold plus countless Elamite troops and others fled from Teumman’s slaughter and sought refuge with Assurbanipal Prism B iv 79 // C v 85 // 66-5-19,1:10′= Borger (1996) 97, 198.

1. Ummanigaš I, king of Elam 743-717 (reigns of Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II): Nothing is known of the circumstances of Ummanigaš’s ac-cession to the Elamite throne, except that it took place during the fifth year of the Babylonian king Nabû-na$ir, according to the Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson [1975] 71 i 9f). The only available infor-mation concerning his parentage dates from long after his reign: An inscription of Assurbanipal lists the thirty-two Elamite royal statues plundered from Susa following its sack in 647; the first of these is a statue of mum-man-i-gaš son of Umbada-râ Prism Avi52//Fv36 = Borger (1996) 54.The sources are silent on the question of relations be-tween Assyria and Elam during the reign of Ti-glath-pileser III, though the Assyrian king is known to have campaigned along the Elamite-Ba-bylonian frontier.

Conversely, the Babylonian Chronicle (Grayson [1975] 73f i 33-37) reports an overwhelming Elamite victory with the Babylonians arriving too late to be a factor. Merodach-baladan claimed vic-tory over Assyria in one of his inscriptions (Frame [1995] 137 ll. 16-18), which is usually interpreted as an oblique reference to the Battle of Der. 
2. Umman(i)gaš, son of Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) (reign of Esarhaddon): This individual has been treated s.v. Mangaš?, where a full discussion can be found; the name has been read variously as mman-ga-áš or [m]um-man-ga-áš (see now RINAP 4 31:7′) but it is clear that the name is a version of the Elamite Huban-nikaš. He may well be the same man who is mentioned in a fragmentary section of a letter from Na’id-Marduk to the queen mother (Naqi’a/Zakutu) concerning the Elamite invasion of the Sealand. The sender reports that the son of Nikkal-iddina has written to the king of Elam and to mhu-ba-ni-ga-áš; details of what the son of Nikkal-iddin wrote are mostly lost but the Assyrian king and his camp are mentioned SAA 18 85:17 (not dated). Reynolds (2003) xxvf suggests that the individual mentioned in SAA 18 85 may be the later Elamite king Huban-nikaš (Ummanigaš) II.€ Waters (2002b). 
3. Ummanigaš II, king of Elam 653-652?, son of Urtaku, brother of Tammaritu (I) and Ummanappa (reign of Assurbanipal): Ummanigaš was a son of Urtaku who fled to Assyria with several other fam-ily members and supporters after Teumman took the Elamite throne. He was killed in 652 or poss-ibly early 651 by Tammaritu (II), who usurped the throne. 
a. In the inscriptions of Assurbanipal: According to the inscriptions of Assurbanipal, mum-man-i-gaš, Ummanappa and Tammaritu, the sons of the Elamite king Urtaku, (as well as) Kudurru and Parrû, the sons of Ummanaldašu, the king who preceded Urtaku, and sixty members of the royal household plus countless Elamite troops and others fled from Teumman’s slaughter and sought refuge with Assurbanipal Prism B iv 79 // C v 85 = Borger (1996) 97; [mum]-man-i-gaš 66-5-19,1:10′= Borger (1996) 198. 
Assurbanipal mounted his second Elamite cam-paign (seventh campaign—Prisms B and C; fourth—Prisms A, F), directed against Teumman who had kept sending his envoys with a view to retrieving mum-man-i-gaš (var. mum-man-ni-gaš), Ummanappa and Tammaritu, sons of Urtaku, king of Elam, as well as Kudurru and Parrû, sons of Ummanaldašu, brother of Urtaku, king of Elam, who had fled and sought refuge with him; however, Assurbanipal did not permit their extradition Prism Biv89//Cv95 = Borger (1996) 97. Abroken passage similarly mentions [mum-man-i]-gaš, Um-manappa, Tammaritu, Kudurru [and Parrû ...] K 3140:1′(SKT 3 74) = Streck (1916) 220ff. Another account refers to mum-man-i-gaš (var. mam-man-i-gaš) son of Urtaku, king of Elam, who had fled from Teumman and sought refuge with the king; after the defeat of Teumman in 653, Assurbanipal took him to Elam and installed him on the throne formerly occupied by Teumman. He also installed Tammaritu, his “third brother,” as king of Hidalu Prism A iii 44 // F ii 67 = Borger (1996) 38; mum-man-i-gaš (var. mum-man-ni-gaš) Prism B vi 6 // C vi 137 = Borger (1996) 104; cf. Borger (1996) 192 (Prism H3); mum-man-[i-gaš] IIT:101 = Fuchs (1996) 277. A relief sequence portrays the installation of Ummanigaš as ruler in Madaktu Russell (1999) 177f Figs. 61-62; the accompa-nying epigraph refers to mu[m-man]-i-gaš “the fugitive, the servant who submitted to me”; the text goes on the record that at Assurbanipal’s command the eunuch he had sent with him brought him joyfully into Susa and Madaktu and set him on the throne of Teumman, whom he (Assurbanipal) had defeated Borger (1996) 302 no. 17; Russell (1999) 175. When Assurbanipal had installed mum-man-i-gaš in Elam, he captured Aplaia son of Nabû-ušal-lim, a grandson of Marduk-apla-iddina (II) who had apparently been living at the Elamite court, and sent him to Assurbanipal Prism B vi 73 // C vii 69 = Borger (1996) 107. However, subsequently mum-man-i-gaš, whom Assurbanipal had helped and installed as king of Elam, failed to heed his oath of loyalty but accepted bribes from the mess-engers sent by Šamaš-šumu-ukin Prism B vii 3 = Borger (1996) 108; similarly mum-man-i-gaš, whom Assurbanipal had helped and installed as king of Elam, failed to heed his oath of loyalty, allied himself with Šamaš-šumu-ukin but Tam-maritu rebelled against him Prism F iii 6 = Borger (1996) 41; mum-man-i-gaš, a fugitive who had sub-mitted to Assurbanipal and whom Assurbanipal had installed as king of Elam, rebelled and went over to the side of Šamaš-šumu-ukin Prism A iii 100 = Borger (1996) 40; when A ssurbanipal’ s forces inflicted a defeat upon Šamaš-šumu-ukin, mum-man-i-gaš MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI accepted bribes from Šamaš-šumu-ukin and went to his as-sistance Prism A iii 136 = Borger (1996) 41. mum-man-i-ga[š], a (former) loyal servant whom Assur-banipal had installed as king of Elam, turned hos-tile and cast off the king’s yoke and took away the property of Esagil and Ezida Prism C vii 124 = Borger (1996) 148. 
Tammaritu rebelled against him and usurped the Elamite throne: Tammaritu, who occupied the Elamite throne after mum-man-i-gaš, also allied himself with Šamaš-šumu-ukin Prism A iv 3 = Borger (1996) 41. mum-man-i-gaš sent Undasu son of Teumman, Zazaz, Parrû, Atta-metu, and Nešu to the assistance of Šamaš-šumu-ukin Prism C viii 10 = Borger (1996) 109; mum-man-i-gaš told them to go against Assyria and avenge their father (i.e. Teumman) Prism C viii 12 = Borger (1996) 109; mum-man-i-gaš specifically ordered Undasu (son of Teumman) to go to Assyria and avenge his father Prism B vii 22 = Borger (1996) 108. Undasu and the other Elamite military leaders set out on campaign with the messengers of Šamaš-šumu-ukin, but Assurbanipal’s troops did battle with them at Mangisi and cut off the heads of Undasu, son of king Teumman, and of Zazaz, Parrû and Atta-metu and brought them before the king. 
Assurbanipal had sent his messengers to mum-man-i-gaš // mum-ma-ni-gaš // [mum-man-i-gaš] but he detained the eunuchs whom the king had dis-patched and did not send a reply Prism B vii 37 // C viii 28 = Borger (1996) 110; BM 128244:11′; see Borger (1996) 199; [m][um]-man-i-gaš is men-tioned again in a very broken context BM 128244:17′. The gods meted out justice to mum-man-i-gaš // mum-man-ni-gaš Prism B vii 42 // C viii 32 = Borger (1996) 110; Tammaritu rebelled aginst him and struck him down, along with his family.

Prism B vii 45 // C viii 35 = Borger (1996) 41. mum-man-i-gaš, Tammaritu, In-dabibi (and) Ummanaldašu, kings who ruled over Elam, all gave their support to the rebel Nabû-bel-šumati Prism A vii 22 = Borger (1996) 59; cf. Prism C viii 81 = Borger (1996) 149.

b. In the royal correspondence: In a letter to the king the sender, identifiable as Nabû-ušabši, gov-ernor of Uruk, tells of the treatment meted out to his brother, Bel-le’i, who had been killed by the Elamites. He says that the corpse of his brother was abused in the presence of mum-ma-ni-g[a-áš DUM]U LUGAL and their (family’s) belongings were taken off to Elam ABL 998:5′(not dated); see Frame (1992) 120 n. 95 (citing a collation by I. Finkel which establishes the reading given here). The letter goes on to report the death of his (i.e. Um-manigaš’s) father (Urtaku), therefore the episode must be dated before Ummanigaš’s flight to Assy-ria which happened after the accession of Teum-man. In a letter to the king from his brother con-cerning the passage of certain boats, Šamaš-šumu-ukin mentions mum-man-ni-gaš, the crown prince (DUMU—MAN) whom the king surely knows to be a loud-mouth ABL 1385:13 (not dated); see Frame (1992) 111 (on the interpretation of the letter). 
In a letter to the elders of Elam, Assurbanipal expresses surprise that they claim not to know the cause of Assyria’s treatment of them. He goes on to explain that it is on account of Nabû-bel-šumati, Nabû-qati-$abat and Kiribtu. He writes that when mum-man-i-gaš came and seized his feet, so that he sent his army with him to assist him against Teum-man, his forces did not plunder anything but rather went in friendship BM 132980:10 (647*); see Wa-ters (2002a) for an edition and study of this letter. 
Assurbanipal writes a letter to an Elamite ally, Menanu; in it he refers to an earlier message of Menanu who had written that since mum-ma-ni-i-gaš, to whom Assurbanipal had shown favour, has transgressed against the king’s loyalty oath and allied himself with the king’s enemies, “we” (i.e. Menanu and his allies) shall rise up against him and avenge Assurbanipal ABL 1380:9; the king then goes on to ask Menanu why he has not yet kept his word and exacted vengeance from mum-man-i-ga-áš ABL 1380:19 (not dated). A fragmentary letter of Assurbanipal mentions five servants of the king who are in Elam; in the same passage mum-man-[i-gaš] is mentioned in a broken context CT 53 931:7′(not dated). 
In a letter to Menanu, Assurbanipal praises him for promising to make an attack on mum-ma-ni-i-gaš to whom Assurbanipal had shown favour but who had transgressed against his loyalty agree-ment and allied himself with the king’s enemy. Later in the letter Assurbanipal mentions the report of his messengers whom Menanu had detained. mum-man-i-ga-áš ABL 1380:9, r. 13 (not dated). 
In a letter to Sin-tabni-u$ur (of Uruk), the king says that he does not believe the slanders that are being made against Sin-tabni-u$ur by Sin-šarru-u$ur and by mum-man-i-gaš; although he (Sin-šarru-u$ur) and mum-man-i-gaš are trying to en-danger Sin-tabni-u$ur’s life, the king reassures him of his confidence in him ABL 290:9, r. 2 (not dated); Frame (1992) 166 n. 165 argues that if this letter is dated to the time of the Šamaš-šumu-ukin revolt, then the Ummanigaš mentioned in it cannot be identified with king Ummanigaš II. 
Note that the Nabû-temple inscription lists Um-manigaš II pulling Assurbanipal’ s chariot with Tammaritu, Pa’ê, and Ummanaldašu (Hallo [1987] 35f, ll. 6-10). 
A number of fragmentary Babylonian letters refer to Ummanigaš: mum-man-i-gaš is mentioned in connection with Der in a letter concerning mili-tary affairs ABL 1127:9′(not dated); a correspond-ent writing to the king from Uruk reports on Elamite affairs in a rather broken context: appar-ently mum-man-i-ga-áš has entered Hidalu; he also mentions the son of mum-man-i-ga-áš and others who were with him ABL 1309:16, 19 (not dated, but the letter mentions Šamaš-šumu-ukin in a con-text that clearly relates to the revolt which began in 652). A badly broken letter attributable to Bel-ibni mentions mum-man-ni-gaš CT 54 456 r. 7′= de Vaan (1995) 348f (not dated).

Elamite, son of Amedirra (reign of Assurbani-pal): In a letter to Assurbanipal, Bel-ibni reports what he has heard about Elam; he writes that mum-man-ni-gaš the son of Amedirra revolted against Ummanaldašu (III) and was supported by Elamites from the river Hudhud (Dez) to Hidalu (an area that encompassed most of southern Khuzistan). Umma-naldašu gathered his forces and they are currently stationed by the river; the king may ask Bel-iqiša, whom Bel-ibni has sent to the king, for a full report ABL 280 r. 16 = de Vaan (1995) 239-243 (not dated). No other sources mention this revolt, which may be dated any time within the reign of Umma-naldašu (c. 648-645).

Individual from the Tupliaš region (reign of Sar-gon II): mum-ma-ni-šá! writes a letter to his brother Šama’gunu informing him that the messengers Šama’gunu sent to him, Aia-saggî and his compan-ion, did not come to him. Aia-saggî was captured in the city centre and was brought to him, but he was not carrying any letter. The writer says that he detained the man until he saw his brother’s mess-enger, and he has now sent both men back to the recipient. Moreover, he has been informed that the messenger can only come back if he is actually bearing a letter. He goes on to state that both kings have now made peace with one another; as for both of them (sender and recipient), each is settled in his parental house. Immaštašu, the legate of the town Hamu, is going to settle in Hamu; he should have helpers appointed there permanently, and his property should not be misappropriated. Finally the sender states that neither of them should leave in case the king hears about it and intervenes SAA 17 155:1 (not dated, but probably in or shortly after 710, when Sargon conquered the region in ques-tion).

*Ummanmenanu (“Humban ...(?)”); Elam.; masc.; wr. mum-ma-an-me-na-nu, mum-man-me-na-nu, mme-na-nu; Tallqvist (1918) 241; Cameron (1936) 166-67; Hinz -Koch (1987) 1230; the Elamite form of the latter part of the name is uncertain, with Huban-immena, Huban-nimena, Huban-menana, and Huban-menanu all postulated in the literature; see also the hypocor. Menanu. 
King of Elam, 692-689 (reign of Sennacherib): Ummanmenanu was the son of Hallušu and younger brother of his predecessor Kutur-Nahhunte (Grayson [1963] 88:14-16, 90:19; Luc-kenbill [1924] 41 v 14-16). Sennacherib’s annals state that after Kutur-Nahhunte died, having reigned less than three months, mum-ma-an-me-na-nu, “who possessed neither sense nor judgement,” his younger(?) brother, ascended the throne Luc-kenbill (1924) 41 v 14; the rebel Babylonian king Šuzubu (Mušezib-Marduk) opened the treasury of the Esagil temple and sent gold and silver items as a bribe to mum-man-me-na-nu LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA. KI // mum-ma-an-me-na-nu LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI “who possessed neither sense nor judgement” Luc-kenbill (1924) 42 v 33; AfO 20 83:14; at the battle of Halulê in 691 mum-ma-an-me-na-nu LUGAL KUR. NIM.MA.KI // mu[m-ma-an-me-na-nu] and the king of Babylon and the Chaldean leaders were over-whelmed by terror and fled for their lives, but Sennacherib sent his forces after them to cut them down Luckenbill (1924) 47 vi 24; AfO 20 83:95. According to the Bavian inscriptions, Sennacherib drew up a battle line in the plain of Halulê against mum-ma-an-me-na-nu [LUGAL] KUR.NIM.[MA.KI] and the king of Babylon together with “many kings of mountain and sea, who were their allies” Luc-kenbill (1924) 82:34. Another account describes Sennacherib’s defeat of the king of Babylon and mum-ma-an-me-na-nu LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI and all their allies AfO 20 83:110. Although Sennach-erib’s inscriptions present the outcome of the battle as an Assyrian victory, the Babylonian Chronicle contradicts this: there, it is stated that mme-na-nu mustered the troops of Elam and Akkad, did battle against Assyria at Halule, and effected an Assyrian retreat Grayson (1975) 80 iii 16. However, shortly afterwards he is said to have been stricken by paralysis and rendered dumb, on 15 Nisannu (i.) of the fourth year of Mušezib-Marduk (689) Grayson (1975) 80 iii 20; see Stolper (1984) 51-53 and Waters (2000) 33-36. Babylon was captured later in the year, and on 7 Addaru (xii.) Menanu (= Ummanmenanu) died Grayson (1975) 81 iii 25.

*Ummanminâ (“Humban ...”); Elam., masc.; wr. mum-ma-an-mi-na-a, mum-man-mi-na-a; Zadok (1984a) 28 (interpreting the name as a variant of Ummanmenanu).
Herald of Elam (reign of Sargon II): In a letter to the governor attributed to Nabû-duru-u$ur, mum-man-mi-na-a LÚ*.NIGÍR is mentioned in a fragmen-tary context in connection with preparations for an Elamite campaign into Ellipi via Bit-Bunakka; he appears to be in correspondence with the son of Daltâ SAA 15 129 9 (not dated); another letter to the governor from [Nabû-duru-u$ur] mentions mum-ma-an-mi-na-a in a broken context SAA 15 130 r. 9 (not dated). These letters relate to the power struggle between Ašpa-bara and Nibê, nephews of Daltâ, in Ellipi in 708, when Ašpa-bara appealed to Sargon and Nibê to Šutur-nahundi; see Fuchs apud Fuchs -Parpola (2001) xxix-xxxi for further background.

*Ummanšibar (“Humban ...”); Elam.; masc.; wr. mum-man-ši-bar, mum-man-ši-bir; Elam. Hu(m)ban-šipir(?); Tallqvist (1918) 241; Cameron (1936) 195; Zadok (1984a) 40; Hinz -Koch (1987) 1231. 
Prominent Elamite active in the early 640s (reign of Assurbanipal): Ummanšibar’s official position in Elam in the early 640s cannot be determined, though some of Bel-ibni’s letters to Assurbanipal reveal his importance in contemporary Elamite af-fairs. In one such letter Bel-ibni reports that the herald, mum-man-ši-bar, Undadu, the zilliru-offi-cial and their allies were fleeing to Šuhari-sungur with the intention of settling in Huhan or Hidalu ABL 281:11 = de Vaan (1995) 243-8 (not dated, but the letter concerns the hunt for Nabû-bel-šumati); it is uncertain whether the title LÚ.NIGIR preceding his name refers to an unnamed official or to Ummanšibar himself (though in that case it might be expected to follow his name). mum-man-ši-[bar] was the recipient of a letter from Assur-banipal himself in 648 in response to his own letter concerning Bel-ibni; the letter is broken and the context is unclear ABL 1170:2 (648*). Bel-ibni reports to the king that on 6-XI mum-man-ši-bir sent Bel-upahhir son of Marduk-zeru-ibni to him in secret with a message to be passed on to the king asking what crime the Elamites had committed, and saying that they were prepared to hand over Nabû-bel-šumati ABL 792:5′= de Vaan (1995) 284-7 (not dated, but the response is dated in 647*, see below). The chronology of events is uncertain, but this episode may have occurred after the first or the second campaign against Ummanaldašu III. The royal letter BM 132980 (dated XI-647*) is a direct response to ABL 792, and although it does not mention Ummanšibar by name, he may be interpreted as the spokesperson of those elders of Elam to whom the letter is addressed (see Waters 2002a). In another letter Bel-ibni reports that mum-man-ši-bar and other nobles have been conspiring against their king and plotting a widespread revolt in Elam; however, they are said to be afraid of Assyrian forces ABL 460:3′(not dated). A frag-mentary letter of Bel-ibni mentions mum-man-š[i-bar] and also Indabibi CT 54 282:11 = de Vaan (1995) 344-5 (not dated).€ Waters (2000) 69, 74, 78.

*Upaš (mng. unknown); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-pa-áš. Tallqvist (1918) 270b already referred to the prefix/preposition Iran. upa “to(wards), at”; simi-larly, Grantovskij (1970) 237f, though without by any means being able to explain the formation. The only plausible solution may be to assume a two-stem shortened name like OIran. Upa-c-a-(based perhaps on Upa-cira) or similar; cf. now also Schmitt (2009) 170f. 
Ruler of the land of Bit-Kapsi (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): In an account of Tiglath-pileser’s ninth regnal year, mú-pa-áš DUMU—mkap-si (“son of Kapsi”) is said to have gathered his people and taken to the mountains; Tiglath-pileser pursued him, defeated him and devastated his cities Tadmor (1994) Ann.14:9 // Ann.4:7; earlier in the account the land of Bit-Kapsi (KUR.[É—kap]-[si], Ann.14:5) is among those to which Tiglath-pileser is said to have marched.

<<H. Baker >>.
*Uperi (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-pe-e-ri, mú-pe-ri.
King of Dilmun (reign of Sargon II): While Uperi brought tribute in Sargon’s twelth regnal year, an account from the sixteenth regnal year names Ahundara as king of Dilmun; presumably he was Uperi’s successor (Fuchs [1994] 416). A number of Sargon’s inscriptions record (with minor vari-ations) that Uperi, king of Dilmun, who like a fish set up his home in the midst of the Sea of the Rising Sun at a distance of thirty double-hours, heard of the power of Sargon (var. Prunk, Kition stele, KAL 3 32: of Aššur, Nabû and Maruk) and brought gifts (var. Kition stele: communicated his subser-vience): [mú-pe]-e-ri LUGAL!

*Uppammâ (“Uppermost, supreme”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mup-pa-am-ma-a. This name has been interpreted as OIran. (Med.) Upama-(cf. Av. up!ma-“uppermost, supreme”), first by Meyer (1909) 5 (cf. Tallqvist [1918] 242b, 270b; Gran-tovskij [1970] 238). The same name has been de-tected in Elam. Ú-ib-ba-ma, Uk-ba-ma by Mayrhofer (1973) 242 no. 8.1681 and Hinz (1975) 244. It is best explained as a shortened form based on a compound name with upama-as one of its elements (like V ed. Upamá-sravas-“most fa-mous”). See also, in more detail, Schmitt (2009) 171f. 
Median city-ruler (reign of Sargon II): m[up]-pa-am-[ma]-a ša URU.ha-[x]-ta-x-na is one of the Me-dian city-lords who pay tribute to Sargon in 713 Fuchs (1998) VI.b:16.

<<H. Baker >>.
*Uppis (perhaps “Well-adorned”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mup-pi-is, mup-pí-is. Already Tallqvist (1918) 30a, 242b, 270b considered this name to be Iran. (although he only later decided on this reading). Herzfeld (1935) 29 presented various speculations as to the root, and indeed it may reasonably be assigned to Med. Hu-pis-(nom. piš or Hu-pai-sah-(nom. sa “well-adorned”, i.e. to the equival-ents of Ved. su-pís-and su-pésas-with the same meaning. Another possibility, though not an easy one, would be to equate the name with Elam. Uk-pi-iš (and U-pi-iš?) or Uk-be-za (and U-pi-iz-za?) (cf. Mayrhofer [1973] 244 nos. 8.1700, 1702) which at best might be derived from a hypocor. OIran. Up-ica-(like Ved. Up-ika-, Up-ila-etc.) or similar. On the other hand, D′jakonov (1956) 262 n. 3 did not recognise any Iran. etymology at all. See now also Schmitt (2009) 172f.

*Uppite (hypocor.); Iran.; masc.; wr. mup-pi-te. An identity with Uppis was considered by Tall-qvist (1918) 30a (cf. pp. 242b, 270b). Other scho-lars, considering an Iran. origin (as suggested by the historical-geographical context), took the name at face value. Thus, Grantovskij (1970) 238 ex-plained it as a hypocor. in -ita-like Med. (OPers.) Xšar-ita (cf. Kaštaritu) or similar, i.e. Up-ita based on some name with OIran. Upa-. A two-stem formation Iran. Hu-p-ita-based on an appropriate compound (cf. Uppis) is equally possible, but there are several objections (with regard to mor-phology and dialectology) to the alternative propo-sal OIran. Hu-paiya considered by Grantovskij (1970) 239. Cf. Schmitt (2009) 173f. 
City-lord of Uriakka (reign of Sargon II): In a letter to the king Mannu-ki-Ninua, writing from Kar-Šarrukin, reports that when he left for an audi-ence with the king, mup-pi-te LÚ*.EN—URU ša URU. ur-ia-ku fled to Šaparda but Nabû-taqqinanni had him captured along with four sons of his SAA 15 101:15 (not dated); he appears to be the subject of another, poorly preserved letter concerning his flight to Šaparda SAA 15 102 (not dated).

Upaš, Uppammâ, etc.). However, Grantovskij (1970) 130 was plainly sceptical; both the small body of the form and its ambiguity (as to reading pu or bu) render analysis almost impossible; cf.

*Urar#aiu (“Urar#ian”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mú-ra-ar-#a-a-a, mú-ra-ár-#a-a-a, mKUR.URI-a-a, mURI-a-a. Note that one instance of the writing mKUR.URI-a-a has been erroneously treated s.v. Akkadaiu. Dalley -Postgate (1984) 175 argued that [mU]RI-a-a in CTN 3 99, was almost certainly identical with ’kdy in the Assur text Lidzbarski no. 2 (see now Hug [1993] AssU 2:3), hence their preferred read-ing, Akkadaiu. However, although there are un-doubted prosopographical connections between some Aramaic texts from Assur and the horse lists from Kalhu (see Dalley -Postgate [1984] 46), it now seems unlikely that these particular writings represent one and the same individual, therefore the argument for reading this name as Akkadaiu is weakened.

URI-[a]-[a] features as neighbouring landowner in the duplicate SAA 6 11:1 (date lost); mURI-a-a is again mentioned as a neighbouring landowner when Inurta-ila’i sells his land several years later SAA 6 13:5 (710); possibly the name of [mKUR.URI-a]-a LÚ.[x x] is to be restored in another land purchase document of Inurta-ila’i (the preceding witness is (the mayor) Muneppiš-ilu, who also precedes him in SAA 6 10) SAA 6 15 r. 8 (date lost); [m]URI-a-a acts as a witness in a fragment of a land sale document; again, he follows Muneppiš-ilu SAA 6 16 r. 5 (date lost); possibly identical with 4.

2. Individual from the town of Maškarit(?) (reign of Sargon II): mARAD—PAB.MEŠ-šú acts as a witness for Gazilu who buys property in the town of Bit-Dagan; he is one of four witnesses from [Maškar]it (P AB 4 IGI.MEŠ UR[U.maš-ka-r]i!-[ta!]-a-a, r. 11) SAA 6 32 r. 10 (707).

7. High official active in Babylon (probably late reign of Esarhaddon and reign of Assurbanipal): In a number of letters probably dating c. 669-667, Urdu-ahhešu reports to the king about the progress of the restoration works on the temples of Babylon, particularly Esagil. He may have been the succes-sor of Mar-Issar, agent of Esarhaddon in Babylonia (see Parpola [1983a] 283): [mARA]D—PAB.MEŠ-šú reports to the king that 138 cedars from Carche-mish have been delivered for the outer cella of Bel; he confirms that all pedestals and necks of the statues have been inscribed with the king’s name SAA 13 162:2 (not dated); [mARAD—PAB.MEŠ-šú] reports to the king on work in Esagil, mentioning 64 cedar roof-beams and 360 door-beams; the architect Didî is said to have refused to release cedar roof-beams SAA 13 163:2 (not dated, but see Parpola [1983a] 256 for a suggested date in 668); mARAD—ŠEŠ.MEŠ-šú tells the king that Esagil has been completely rebuilt and is ready for the rites. However, he reports that the king of Babylon (Šamaš-šumu-ukin) has told them to rebuild the continuous enclosure wall of Esagil and the temple of Belet-Babili SAA 13 168:2 (not dated, but see Parpola [1983a] 283 n. 522 for a suggested date in 668). 
The following additional letters dealing with res-toration works in Babylon may be attributed to Urdu-ahhešu though their opening sections are lost: SAA 13 161; SAA 13 164; SAA 13 165; SAA 13 123; SAA 13 166; SAA 13 172; SAA 13 171; SAA 13 170; SAA 13 169.€ Streck (2002) 225ff (for the dates of the letters). 
8. Landowner from Nineveh (reign of Assur-banipal): m ARA D—P A B.MEŠ-šú owns land adjoining an estate in the province of the chief cupbearer which is bought by Remanni-Adad, chief chariot driver of [Assurbanipal, king of] Assyria SAA 6 334:23 (date lost). 
9. Father of Inurta-le’i, from Kalhu (reign of Assurbanipal): Inurta-le’i son of mARAD—P AP.MEŠ-e-šú! (coll. courtesy R. Jas) acts as a witness for Sinqi-Issar who buys a young slave girl ND 2082 r. 21 (638*); m ARA D—P A B.MEŠ-šú acts as a witness for Ezbu who buys the female slave Nikkal-šeiagi from Nergal-le’i ND 2326 r. 23 (637*); mARAD— PAB.MEŠ-šú acts as a witness for Nabû-nadin-ahhe who buys the slave Bel-Harran-duri from Nergal-eriba ND 2323 r. 7 (637*). The latter two tablets were written on the same day and a number of witnesses, named in the same order, are common to both; this raises the question of whether the sellers Nergal-le’i 1. (-ZU) and Nergal-eriba 1. (-SU) might actually be the same person. 
10. Individual from Assur (reign of Assurbani-pal): mARAD—PAB.MEŠ-šú owes ten shekels of silver to Indî StA T 2 75:3 (656) and the envelope StA T 2 76:1, 4 (656).

12. Father of Sukkaia, from Assur or the vicinity (reign of Assurbanipal and possibly later): Accord-ing to a labour contract Šumma-Aššur, mARAD— PAB.MEŠ-šú and Kanunaiu are to glaze 2,000 bricks for Nabû-šar-ahhešu SAAB 9 140A:4 (637*) and on a fragment of envelope SAAB 9 140B:2 (date lost); Sukkaia, son of mARAD—P AB.MEŠ-[šú], from Bit-Ša-ili-bani, takes twenty-five homers of barley from Nabû-šar-ahhešu SAAB 9 135:3 (636* or 625*). 
13. Individual from Assur (reign of Assurbani-pal): mARAD—PAB.MEŠ-šú acts as a witness in a fragmentary sale document sealed by the chief bow-maker Issar-šarru-ibni SAA 14 459 r. 7′(635*); on the question of the tablet originating in Assur, see Radner (1999) 112 and Issar-šarru-ibni 1. 
14. Individual associated with the Zababa temple at Assur (reign of Assurbanipal or later): m ARA D—P A P.MEŠ-šú IGI É—za-ba-ba is listed with two shekels in a tablet of accounts connected with the second trading venture of Habil-kenu Radner (forthcoming) I.33:6 (not dated); mARAD—P AP.MEŠ-šú IGI É—za-ba-ba is listed with four and a half shekels in a similar tablet of accounts (which lacks a heading) Radner (forthcoming) I.56 r. 5 (not dated).

*Urdu-Aia, Urdu-Ea (“Servant of Ea”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mARAD—dÉ.A, mARAD—É.A, mARAD—d60, mARAD—da-a, mARAD—a-a, mARAD-e-a, mur-di-ia; Tallqvist (1918) 25f. The writings without divine determinative might alternatively be interpreted as Urdaia, a hypocor. based on urdu “servant”. 
1. Individual from Huzirina (reign of Shal-maneser III): mARAD!—a-a acts as a witness when Aššur-kenu pledges his field to Ziâ Billa 68:12 (830). 
2. Eunuch at the royal court of Kalhu (reign of Adad-nerari III): m[ARAD]—[d!]É.A [KI.MIN] (for L[Ú*!.S]AG! in ii 14) receives a ration of wine ac-cording to a wine list from Kalhu NWL 3 + CTN 3 145 ii 15 (784). 
3. Official from Babylon (reign of Sargon II): [mAR]AD—dÉ.A writes a letter in Babylonian lan-guage and script to “Sargon, king of the lands”; the text is fragmentary but mentions Balassu, Marduk-ahu-eriba and Marduk-apla-iddina (Merodach-ba-ladan II) SAA 17 51:1 (not dated). 
4. Weaver of multicoloured trim, from Nineveh (reign of Sennacherib): mARAD—a-a LÚ.UŠ.BAR— GÙN acts as the first witness for Šumma-ilani, the chariot driver of the chamberlain SAA 6 42 r. 8 (692). 
5. Chief lamentation priest (galamahhu) of Sin of Harran and the king, descendant of Šumu-libši, father of Nabû-zeru-iddina and Nabû-le’i (reign of Esarhaddon): a. Urdu-Ea belongs to a family of high-ranking lamentation priests. The writing of his name with —dÉ.A betrays his Babylonian origins. While he and his son Nabû-zeru-iddina bore the title of “gala-mahhu of Sin of Harran and the king,” their ances-tor Šumu-libši was the galamahhu at Esagil, Mar-duk’s temple in Babylon. This is known from the colophons of three tablets copied by Urdu-Ea’s son Nabû-zeru-iddina from originals from his ancestor Šumu-libši’s library: According to its colophon, Nabû-zeru-iddina, lamentation priest of Sin and the king, son of mARAD—dÉ.A, descendant of the chief lamentation priest Šumu-libši, copied an ex-tract of UKKIN-TA EŠ-BAR-RA TIL-LA from an old wax tablet of the house of Šumu-libši Hunger (1968) no. 499:4; according to its colophon, Nabû-zeru-iddina, aštalû of Sin, son of mARAD—dÉ.A GALA.MAH dEN.ZU šà ŠÀ URU.har-ra-an, descendant of Šumu-libši, the chief lamentation priest of Esagil in Babylon, copied another text from a tab-let of Šumu-libši’s library Hunger (1968) no. 500:2; Nabû-zeru-iddina son of mARAD—dÉ.A ŠÚ. MAH 30 u LUGAL copied another text according to its colophon Hunger (1968) no. 524:2; Nabû-le’i son of [m]ARAD—dÉ.A copied a ritual tablet in Baby-lonian script CTN 4 187 r. 23. 
b. Despite his position at the Sin temple at Har-ran, Urdu-Ea was also, at least at times, a resident at the royal palace of Nineveh: This is clear from a list of officials at court in which mARAD—dÉ.A LÚ.GALA is mentioned SAA 7 5 i 51 (not dated). 
c. Urdu-Ea was a frequent correspondent of king Esarhaddon, both on his own and as part of inter-disciplinary groups of scholars advising the king. 
1′. As the sole author of letters to the king: mARAD—dÉ.A informs the king about the arrange-ments for the New Year Festival for Sin (of Har-ran); the garments (of the king) which are to be blessed by the god need to be collected and Urdu-Ea asks the king to provide him with a bodyguard “because of the traitors” SAA 10 338:2 (not dated; can be attributed to 670); [mAR]AD—É.A informs the king about the procession of the gods of Kurbail; he also asks for the royal garments SAA 10 339:2 (not dated); [Urdu-Ea] informs the king about a nocturnal kettledrum performance upon the royal garments before Nergal (i.e., Mars) and Saturn in order to invoke their blessing for the king SAA 10 340:2 (not dated; can be attributed to 670); [Urdu-Ea] informs the king about a nocturnal kettledrum performance before Marduk in order to invoke his blessing for the king SAA 10 341:2 (not dated); mARAD—[dÉ.A] informs the king about a nocturnal kettledrum performance before Dilbat (i.e., V enus) SAA 10 342:2 (not dated); another letter of mARAD—dÉ.A concerns the cult of Sin and Nikkal at Harran SAA 10 343:2 (not dated); only the begin-ning of another letter of mARAD—dÉ.A to the king has survived SAA 10 344:2 (not dated). 
2′. As co-author of letters to the king: Nabû-zeru-lešir (chief scribe), Adad-šumu-u$ur (the king’ s exorcist), Nabû-šumu-iddina (astrologer), [mARAD]—dÉ.A and Issar-šumu-ereš (chief scribe) inform the king (“the farmer”) that they will come to Nineveh, presumably in order to enthrone a substitute king SAA 10 1:4 (not dated; can be dated to 679 or 674); Issar-šumu-ereš, [mARAD—d]É.A and Marduk-šakin-šumi (exorcist) inform the king how they propose to protect the king from the evil effects of a solar eclipse SAA 10 25:3 (not dated; can be dated to 669); Adad-šumu-u$ur and mARAD— dÉ.A write jointly to the king, addressed as the “farmer,” informing him about various purifica-tion rites they are involved in SAA 10 212:3; specifically, [m]ARAD—dÉ.A will perform a rite be-fore Enlil SAA 10 212:13 (not dated; can be dated to 669); Adad-šumu-u$ur, [mARAD]—[d!]É.A, Issar-šumu-ereš and Akkullanu (astrologer) write a joint letter to the king which is broken after the intro-ductory formula SAA 10 232:4 (not dated). 
d. Urdu-Ea is also mentioned in the letters of other scholars to the king that make reference to his work: The exorcist Marduk-šakin-šumi details to the king how to expel an evil demon with the help of the incantations “Verily you are evil” and “Begone demon”; he then mentions that the exor-cist Nabû-gamil should perform against an auspi-cious constellation of moon and sun and suggests that the latter should also perform these rites for mARAD—d60 SAA 10 238 r. 20 (not dated; can be dated to 672); in another letter, Marduk-šakin-šumi gives a detailed update on his recent doings and outlines upcoming duties; he also mentions that mARAD—dÉ.A will perform incantations on the palace roof this very night SAA 10 240:19 (not dated; can be dated to 671); a fragmentary letter of an unknown writer mentions a meeting of the exor-cist Adad-šumu-u$ur with Aššur-na$ir, the chief eunuch, Sasî and mARAD—d[É].[A] in Nineveh SAA 10 377 r. 2 (not dated; can be dated to 670); the exorcist Nabû-nadin-šumi (in a letter without proper address) mentions dealings in Arbail con-cerning (royal) garments that also involve mARAD— dÉ.[A] SAA 10 287:5 (not dated); a letter without introduction, probably the second tablet of a letter of the chief scribe Issar-šumu-ereš (see Parpola [1983a] 334), answers in the affirmative to the king’s question whether he has been purified by mARAD—[d]É.A SAA 10 29:1 (not dated; can be assigned to the beginning of Assurbanipal’s reign); this last letter seems to refer to activities of Urdu-Ea which took place before A ssurbanipal’ s coro-nation; during the reign of this king, Urdu-Ea’s son Nabû-zeru-iddina takes over his father’s duties as chief lamentation priest of Sin of Harran and of the king. 
e. That Urdu-Ea also copied extracts of various collections of celestial omina, an area far outside of his specialization as lamentation priest, bears witness to the fact that the scholars employed by the Assyrian royal court were extremely versatile. A tablet with three celestial omina is signed by mARAD—dÉ.A SAA 8 181 r. 5 (not dated, can be assigned to 673); a tablet with two thunder omina is signed by mARAD—d[É.A] SAA 8 182 r. 1 (not dated, can be assigned to 672); a tablet with two moon omina is signed by [m]ARAD—dÉ.A SAA 8 183:6 (not dated).€ Parpola (1971) 43f. 
6. Individual from Assur (reign of Esarhaddon): mARAD—a-a acts as a witness in a lawsuit involving Tarditu-Aššur, Bel-ahu-iddina and Bel-ahhe-eriba StAT 3 111 r. 9 (676).

*Urdu-Mullissu (“Servant of Mullissu”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mARAD—dNIN.LÍL; ft. Bibl. ’drmlk (2 Kings 19:37, Isaiah 37:38); in classical sources: Adramelos (Berossos fragment of Abydenos), Ar-dumuzan (fragment of Polyhistor); Tallqvist (1918) 25 (s.v. Arad-Belit); Parpola (1980) 174. 
1. Son and murderer of Sennacherib, crown prince between 698 and 684 (reign of Sennache-rib): The title of Urdu-Mullissu is known from a legal document according to which Aplaia, the “third man” of mARAD—dNIN.LÍL DUMU—MAN, ac-quired the son of Zunbu SAA 6 103:5 (694). 
That he conspired against his father Sennacherib to have him killed is known from a fragmentarily preserved Babylonian letter from Nineveh, written by an unknown sender to Esarhaddon sometime after the events recorded took place. According to this letter a man whose name is lost tried to warn the king about the conspiracy, without success. When he requested an audience, two officials called Nabû-šumu-iškun and \illâ inquired about his concern; his answer was that it concerned m ARAD—[d][NIN.LÍL] SAA 18 100:10; this caused the officials, who were supporters of the prince, to lead him veiled, as was the custom, into the presence not of the king, but of mARAD—dNIN.[LÍL] himself SAA 18 100 r. 1; he then gave his state-ment: “Your son, mARAD—[d][NIN.LÍL], will kill you!” SAA 18 100 r. 4; thereupon his face was uncovered and it became apparent that mARAD— dNI[N.LÍL] had interrogated him; he and his brothers were killed by the conspirators SAA 18 100 r. 6; later on in the letter, the activities of the troops of the household of mAR[AD—dNIN.LÍL] are mentioned in broken context, possibly referring to the succes-
sion war after the murder of Sennacherib in 681 which was won by Esarhaddon SAA 18 100 r. 11 (not dated). The Neo-Assyrian sources offer no information about the further fate of Urdu-Mullis-su; that he fled to Urar#u is known only from the Biblical and Greek sources. However, a letter by the Babylonian astronomer Bel-ušezib to king Esarhaddon alludes to mARAD—dNIN!.[LÍL!] in a broken passage concerned with the loyalty of Mar-dia, the court overseer of the household of the chief eunuch SAA 10 113 r. 5 (not dated).€ Parpola (1980); Frahm (1997) 18.

*Urdu-Nabû (“Servant of Nabû”); Akk.; masc.; wr. mARAD—dAG, mARAD—dPA; ft. ’rdnbw, ‘rdnbw; Tallqvist (1918) 27. 
1. Father of Kukulanu (Kakkullanu), from Kalhu (reign of Sargon II): Kukulanu son of mARAD—dAG acts as a witness for the palace scribe Nabû-kabti-ahhešu SAA 6 31 r. 17 (709).€ Radner (1997c) 19-23, 27f (for an edition and copy of the text).

5. Priest of the Nabû temple at Kalhu (reign of Esarhaddon): Urdu-Nabû is the author of a number of letters to king Esarhaddon, dealing with various cultic matters. Most of his letters feature a charac-teristic blessing after the usual introduction formu-la: “May Aššur, Šamaš, Marduk (also called Bel), Zarpanitu, Nabû, Tašmetu, Ištar of Nineveh and Ištar of Arbail — these great gods who love your kingship — allow the king, my lord, to live 100 years. May they grant the king, my lord, the satis-faction of old age, extreme old age.” The only exceptions are SA A 13 59 and SA A 13 63. Urdu-Nabû’s title as a priest is given in SAA 13 126 r. 7, a letter of his collegue Iddinaia, the priest of Ninurta of Kalhu. Despite the fact that Urdu-Nabû is not explicitly called a priest of Nabû, his affilia-tion with this god’s sanctuary, next to the Ninurta temple the most important shrine at Kalhu, is ob-vious from the contents of SAA 13 56 and SAA 13 57. His responsibilities, however, also included matters concerning other gods such as Aššur, Sin, Ištar and Adad-of-Plenty. 
a. Urdu-Nabû’s letters to Esarhaddon: mARAD— dPA informs the king about the sacrifices made to Nabû and his consort Tašmetu on behalf of the lives of the king himself and his children Assur-banipal (called “great crown prince”), Šamaš-šumu-ukin (called “crown prince of Babylon”), Šeru’a-e#irat, Aššur-mukin-pale’a and Aššur-etel-šamê-er$eti-muballissu; the reference to the crown princes allows the letter to be dated to the period after 672 SAA 13 56:2 (not dated); another frag-mentarily preserved letter of [mARAD]—dAG to the king concerns the sacrifices on behalf of the royal sons to Nabû’s consort Tašmetu SAA 13 57:2 (not dated); mARAD—dPA informs the king about two impending open-air rituals, one involving the gods Aššur and Sin and the other Adad-nuhše (Adad-of-Plenty) SAA 13 58:2 (not dated); mARAD—dAG writes to the king about the preparations for a festival of Ištar SAA 13 59:2 (not dated); [Urdu-Nabû] reports on some offerings and asks about how to treat a request of a delegation from Babylon and Borsippa concerning the festival of Babylon; the delegation includes the clergyman Marduk-zeru-ibni, grandson of the clergyman E#iru (see also SAA 13 174); the letter can be attributed to Urdu-Nabû because of the characteristic blessing formula SAA 13 60 (not dated); mARAD—dPA asks the king to make available gold for the fabrication of statues of the king and his mother, i.e. Naqia SAA 13 61:2 (not dated); a fragmentary letter of mARAD—dP A concerns the problems arising from the loss of the keys to several temple locks SAA 13 62:2 (not dated); due to its broken state, the con-tents of another letter of mARAD—dPA are unclear; he seems urgently to request the king’s attention in a certain matter SAA 13 63:2 (not dated); another letter of mARAD—dP A is also badly broken; it reports the happy news that an affair of an unknown nature could be dropped as it was of no concern SAA 13 64:2 (not dated); mARAD—dPA reports that he has spotted two beautiful girls and gives information about time and place (the temple in one case, the royal road in the other) and the girls’ family back-ground; he does not specify why this might be of interest to the king SAA 13 65:2 (not dated); in a letter which can be attributed to Urdu-Nabû be-cause of the characteristic blessing formula, he explains his failure to go to Assur by informing the king about his serious illness and asks that he be provided with an exorcist and a physician to heal him SAA 13 66:2 (not dated); of another letter of mARAD—d[P A] nothing but the introductory formula is preserved SAA 13 67:2 (not dated); two more fragments can be identified as belonging to the letter corpus of Urdu-Nabû owing to the typical blessings SAA 13 68 (not dated); SAA 13 69 (not dated). 
b. Mentioned in other authors’ letters to Esar-haddon: Two letters bear witness to Urdu-Nabû’s involvement with Babylonian affairs. One was written by Šamaš-šumu-ukin, crown prince of Bab-ylon, who informs his father about the content of a letter he received from some men from Babylon and Borsippa, accusing the haruspex Aplaia and the astrologers Bel-e#ir and Šamaš-zeru-iqiša of neglecting their duties and of treason against the king; apparently, the three men are closely watched and their mail is intercepted as Šamaš-šumu-ukin also reports the contents of a letter written by mARAD—dPA to the two astrologers SAA 16 21 r. 9 (not dated). That Urdu-Nabû’s contacts with the Babylonian clergy are of a potentially sensitive nature is also apparent from a letter of the Babylonian priest Raši-il to the king; he is accus-ing Marduk-zeru-ibni, a clergyman from Babylon who previously denounced him, of theft and stresses that while the latter relied on mARAD—dAG and Nadinu (= Iddinaia, Ninurta’s priest at Kalhu), he himself only ever trusted in the king SAA 13 174 r. 7 (not dated); the said Marduk-zeru-ibni’s contacts with Urdu-Nabû are documented in one of Urdu-Nabû’s own letters, SAA 13 60. Two more letters concern internal affairs. In one of them, Iddinaia, the priest of the Ninurta temple at Kalhu, informs the king about the fact that mARAD—dPA LÚ.SANGA has appropriated a field, a house and some descendants of temple votaries SAA 13 126 r. 7 (not dated). In the other letter, one Nabû-bani-ahhe informs the king about the ongoing manufac-ture of statues of gold and copper and complains of the lack of lapis lazuli; he suggests that to compensate for this he should receive a monthly copper shipment, just like mARAD—dPA SAA 13 127 r. 8 (not dated). 
c. Mentioned in a list of personnel of the Nabû temple: mARAD—dPA is mentioned in a fragmentary context in a list of personnel of the Nabû temple Sumer 30 64 r. 15 (not dated). 
6. Individual, possibly from Šadikanni (reign of Esarhaddon): mARAD—dAG [LÚ*].[x x x] acts as a witness for Adda-kabar who buys a slave from the city lord of Šadikanni SAA 6 286 r. 8 (670).

Alternative-ly, an Arabian name is possible, cf. ‘rgn and ‘rg’ < Arab. “lameness” in Palmyra (Stark [1971] 107a).

*Uriaikki (mng. unknown); Anat.; masc.; wr. mú-ri-ia-ik-ki, mú-ri-ik-ki, mú-ri-ik; ft. Phœn. ’wrk, Luw. wa/i-ra/i-ku-sa (Luw.) (bilingual inscription from Karatepe); Tadmor (1994) 55, note to 8′; Hawkins (2000) 44. 
King of Que (i.e., Cilicia) (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): a. Mentioned in Tiglath-pileser’s inscriptions: In 738, he brought tribute to Tiglath-pileser in the city of Arpad; the Kalhu Annals contain a list of the various kings from Tabal, Northern Syria and the Mediterranean coast as well as the Arab queen Zabibê who handed over tribute on that occasion: mú-ri-ik-ki KUR.qu-ú-a-a // mú-ri-ia-ik-ki KUR.[qu-ú-a-a] // mú-ri-ia-ik-ki KUR.qu-ú-[a-a] // mú-ri-ia-ik-ki KUR.qu-ú-a-a Tadmor (1994) Ann.13*:11 // 21:8′// 3:4 // 27:3. The event is also recorded on Tiglath-pileser’ s royal stele from Iran: mú-ri-ik KUR.qu-ú-a-[a] Tadmor (1994) St.III A:8. A sum-mary inscription from Kalhu names the tribute bearers of 738, among them mú-ri-ik KUR.qu-u-a-a, as well as those of 734 Tadmor (1994) Summ. 7 r. 7′(this text should not be used as evidence inde-pendently of the Kalhu Annals). 
b. Mentioned in a letter authored by Sargon II: In 709, Mitâ of Muški (i.e., Midas of Phrygia) hands over a group of fourteen men from Que to Aššur-šarru-u$ur, the govornor of Que, now an Assyrian province; these men were previously sent by m[ú-ri]-ik as a delegation to Urar#u; Sargon reacts to the news with great enthusiasm, as it constitutes the first proof of the change of Phry-gia’s hitherto hostile attitude towards Assyria; he orders Aššur-šarru-u$ur to immediately release all Phrygians held captive in Que to Mitâ SAA 1 1:5 = CTN 5 188-92 (not dated). This reference has been taken as evidence for the hypothesis that Uriaikki remained in power as ruler of a part of Que even after the installation of the Assyrian province, or that he was in exile (cf. Hawkins [2000] 42 with earlier literature). Fuchs (1994) 455 convincingly argues against this, assuming that the ambassadors were sent on their mission to Assy-ria’s enemy Urar#u when Uriaikki turned against Assyria, sometime during the reign of Shalmaneser V; this betrayal eventually led to the downfall of Uriaikki and the integration of Que into the Assy-rian empire as a province. Thereupon, the delega-tion from Que did not return to their native country, but sought refuge at the court of the anti-Assyrian Mitâ and remained there safely until a change of the latter’s policy towards Assyria caused them to be handed over to the Assyrians. 
c. Possibly mentioned in the bilingual inscrip-tions (Phœnician and Hieroglyphic Luwian) on the two city gates at Karatepe: It has been suggested that Uriaikki king of Que is identical with Awari-kus the Adanawean king = ’wrk king of the dnnym as mentioned in the inscriptions of Azatiwatas = ’ztwd at Karatepe (for a final edition see now Haw-kins [2000] 45-68: KARATEPE 1). While the identity of the personal names (see Hawkins [2000] 44) and also the equation of Que with the country of Adanawa (i.e., the city of Adana, see Hawkins [2000] 40) is in no doubt, the identifica-tion of Awarikus in the Karatepe inscriptions and of Uriaikki of Que in Tiglath-pileser’s inscriptions poses serious chronological problems, and A wari-kus may well have been a homonymous predeces-sor of Uriaikki (see Hawkins [2000] 44f with ear-lier literature).

HDB notes: Though it has been assumed in the edition and elsewhere that she is identical with 1., it is not possible that she could have made the transition from a girl of c. 1 metre height to an old woman in only eight years, thus it seems better to keep these two individuals separ-ate. Even allowing for the uncertainty in the post-canonical eponym sequence, the interval remains too short for her to have reached an age sufficiently advanced for it to be expressly noted that she was “old”.

King of Tuhana (i.e. Luwian/Greek Tyana) in Tabal, son of Muwaharanis and father of Muwaha-ranis (reigns of Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon II): Urpallâ of the Assyrian sources has long been identified with Warpalawas in the Hieroglyphic Luwian inscriptions (see Hawkins [2000] 429 with earlier literature). Based on the distribution of these inscriptions, it is clear that the kingdom of Tuhana encompassed the latter Greek Tyanitis and thus controlled the upper end of the Cilician Gates (see Hawkins -Postgate [1988] 38). A stele from Ivriz shows that Warpalawas’ father was Muwaha-ranis, and according to a stele from Nigde, Warpa-lawas in turn had a son called Muwaharanis (see Hawkins [2000] 430 with note 63). 
a. Mentioned in the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser III: In 738, five Tabalean rulers pay their tribute to Tiglath-pileser in Arpad; the event is recorded in the Kalhu Annals: mur-pal-la-[a KUR. tu-ha-na-a-a] // mur-pal-la-a KUR.tu-[ha-na]-a-a // mur-pal-la-a KUR.tu-ha-na-a-a Tadmor (1994) Ann.3:6 // 14*:1 // 27:7. The same event is re-corded in Tiglath-pileser’s royal stele from Iran: mur-pal-la-a KUR.tú-ha-na-a-[a] Tadmor (1994) St..III A:12. A summary inscription from Kalhu lists the tribute bearers of 738, among them mur-pal-la-a URU.tu-ha-na-a-a, together with those of 734 Tadmor (1994) Summ. 7 r. 9 (this text should not be used independently of the Kalhu Annals). 
b. Mentioned in an administrative document: A fragmentary list found at Nineveh names various Taurus rulers who have delivered their yearly trib-ute to Assyria; on the obverse, [mur]-pal-a is men-tioned as having delivered horses and mules SAA 11 30:7 (not dated), on the reverse, mur-pal-la-a is one of nine rulers listed as having delivered stone and horses SAA 11 30 r. 8 (not dated); the text may concern the period between 743 and 738, see Haw-kins -Postgate (1988) 39. 
c. Mentioned in a letter authored by Sargon II: In a letter written in 709 by Sargon II to Aššur-šarru-u$ur, his governor in Que, the king reacts to the good news that friendly relations with Mitâ of Muški (i.e., Midas of Phrygia) have been estab-lished after long years of hostility; in this context, mention is made of a messenger of m[u]r-pal-a who has requested an audience with the governor SAA 1 1:26 = CTN 5 188ff (not dated); the king orders Aššur-šarru-u$ur to receive the messenger, how-ever invoking the gods to command that “all these kings should wipe your (i.e., Aššur-šarru-u$ur’s) sandals with their beards!”, which clearly indicates the king’s wish that after the peace with Phrygia the Tabalean rulers, now trapped between Phrygia and Assyria, should not be treated too generously. His strong belief that the kings of Tabal were now powerless is expressed also in the king’s reaction to Aššur-šarru-u$ur’s worries about mur-pal-a in regard to the recent conquest of Bit-Burutaš by the Tabalean entities Atuna and Istuanda SAA 1 1 r. 5 = CTN 5 188ff (not dated); Sargon was ultimately proven to be wrong by his death only four years later on the battlefield in Tabal, which remained beyond Assyrian control ever after (see Hawkins -Postgate [1988] 37f). 
d. Mentioned in Hieroglyphic Luwian inscrip-tions at Ivriz, Bor, Bulgarmaden and Nigde (cf. Hawkins [2000] 432): Three inscriptions of War-palawas king of Tuwana are known from Ivriz and Bor: one on a rock relief (edition: Hawkins [2000] 516-518: IVRIZ 1) and two on stelae (edition: Hawkins [2000] 518-521: BOR; for the unpub-lished stele IVRIZ 2, see Hawkins (2000) 430, 526). Warpalawas is mentioned in the inscription of his son Muwaharanis on a stele from Nigde (edition: Hawkins [2000] 526f: NIGDE 2) and also in the inscription of his vassal Tarhunazas on the rock relief in Bulgarmaden (edition: Hawkins [2000] 521-526: BULGARMADEN).

*Urtaku (mng. unknown); Elam.?; masc.; wr. mur-ta-ki, mur-ta-ku, mur-tag, mur-ta-gi, mur-ta-gu; Tallqvist (1918) 244; Zadok (1984a) 42, 46f; Hinz -Koch (1987) 1248. 
1. King of Elam, 675-664, brother of Ummanal-dašu I, Ummanaldašu II, Teumman and possibly also Ummanigaš, father of Ummanigaš (II), Um-manappa and Tammaritu (I), grandfather of Umba-kidini and Ummanamni (reigns of Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal): The Babylonian Chronicle and the Esarhaddon Chronicle record the accession of ur-ta-gu // mur-ta-gu, brother of his predecessor Um-manaldašu (II), as king of Elam in 675 Grayson (1975) 84 iv 13 // 126:18. A query to the sun-god asks whether the peace overture made by mur-ta-gi LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI to Esarhaddon is sincere SAA 4 74:2 (no year date). Other sources attest to friendly relations at this time: the Babylonian and Esarhaddon Chronicles reveal that Elam returned Ištar and other gods of Akkad to Babylonia, an event also referred to in Esarhaddon’s inscriptions (Grayson [1975] 84 iv 17-18, 126:21-22 and RINAP 4 105 vii 5-11). The peace treaty between Assyria and Elam is also alluded to in a letter from the crown prince (Šamaš-šumu-ukin) to Šulmu-beli-lušme (see SAA 18 7). In a letter to the king, the governor of Nippur writes that last year the king of Elam resisted attempts to persuade him to invade Chaldea and wrest it from Assyrian control, saying that he would not disregard his adê-agree-ment (see SAA 18 202:9-16). A letter from Esar-haddon to mur-ta-ku mentions the well-being of the latter’s sons and daughters and expresses a wish for the well-being of mur-ta-ku and for that of his own sons and daughters, clear evidence for an exchange of royal children between the courts of Assyria and Elam SAA 16 1:2, 6 (not dated). 
Peaceful relations continued into the early part of Assurbanipal’ s reign, when Assurbanipal sent grain to Urtaku and gave refuge to Elamites fleeing conditions of drought (Prism B iv 18-26 // C v 24-35 = Borger [1996] 94f). In a letter to the elders of Rašu, however, Assurbanipal mentions an un-specified evil that the Elamites have done to him despite the fact that, in the days of mur-tag, he rescued Elam from famine ABL 295:10 (not dated). The inscriptions of Assurbanipal record Urtaku’s invasion of Babylonia, stressing that it was unexpected and that the king himself did not believe the first reports about it. The change in policy may be attributed to Teumman’s influence (Waters 1999b). In his first Elamite ‘ampaign (fsixth ‘ampaignf—Prisms B and C), usually dated to 664, Assurbanipal marched against mur-ta-ki MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI // [mur-ta-ki MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI] who had disregarded his loyalty agreement, des-pite Assurbanipal’s assistance Prism B iv 18 // C v 24 = Borger (1996) 94. Another account refers to mur-ta-gi LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI, an ally of the king’s father, to whom Assurbanipal provided re-lief during a time of famine Prism H1 iii 10′= Borger (1996) 190. The Gambulean leader Bel-iqiša and Nabû-šumu-ereš, the governor of Nippur, both (formerly) loyal servants of Assurbanipal, and Marduk-šumu-ibni, the eunuch of mur-ta-ki, incited him to attack Sumer and Akkad and mus-tered their troops Prism B iv 30 // C v 42 = Borger (1996) 95; mur-ta-ki LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI // mur-ta-ku MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI, that is, mur-ta-ki // [mur-ta-ku], to whom Assurbanipal had not been hostile, attacked Babylonia Prism B iv 32, 33 // C v 45, 46 = Borger (1996) 95; messengers came from Elam to Nineveh on behalf of the Elamite nobility, but Assurbanipal did not credit what they said con-cerning the rebellion of mur-ta-ki Prism B iv 38 // C v 48 = Borger (1996) 95; it was only after sending his own messenger that he was convinced of their account and mounted his campaign in re-sponse. Upon hearing of Assurbanipal’s advance, he (the enemy) fled in fear, and Assurbanipal pur-sued him to the border of Elam and inflicted a defeat; mur-ta-ku LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI // mur-ta-ki MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI, who had not kept his alliance with Assurbanipal, died a premature death in dis-tress Prism B iv 54 // C v 62 = Borger (1996) 96. The god Marduk imposed a grave punishment upon Marduk-šumu-ibni, his eunuch, who had incited mur-ta-ki to rebel Prism B iv 65 // C v 73 = Borger (1996) 96. The date of Urtaku’s death is not preserved in the Chronicles mentioned above (owing to a gap between 668 and 626), but it is usually assigned to 664, based on the assumption that it occurred in the same year that he invaded Babylonia; see Frame (1992) 119 n. 93 for discus-sion of the chronological problems. 
After Urtaku’s death, Teumman ascended to the throne of mur-ta-ki // mur-ta-ku Prism B iv 75 // C v 81 = Borger (1996) 97; he sought to kill the sons of mur-ta-ki and the sons of Ummanaldašu, brother of mur-ta-ki Prism B iv 76, 78 // C v 82, 84 = Borger (1996) 97; Ummanigaš, Ummanappa and Tam-maritu, the sons of mur-ta-ki LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA. KI, Kudurru and Parrû, the sons of Ummanaldašu, the king who preceded mur-ta-ki // mur-ta-[ki], and sixty members of the royal household plus count-less Elamite troops and others fled from Teum-man’s slaughter and sought refuge with Assurbani-pal Prism Biv80,82//Cv86,88 = Borger (1996) 97. Assurbanipal mounted his second Elamite cam-paign (seventh ‘campaign—Prisms B and C; second campaign—A, F), directed against Teumman who had kept sending his envoys with a view to retriev-ing Ummanigaš, Ummanappa and Tammaritu, sons of mur-ta-ki LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI // mur-ta-ku MAN KUR.NIM.MA.KI, as well as Kudurru and Parrû, sons of Ummanaldašu, brother of mur-ta-ki LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI, who had fled and sought refuge with him; however, Assurbanipal did not permit their extradition Prism B iv 90, 92 // C v 96, 98 = Borger (1996) 97. Another account refers to Um-manigaš, son of mur-ta-ki MAN // LUGAL KUR.NIM.MA.KI, who had fled from Teumman and sought refuge with the king; subsequently Assur-banipal took him to Elam and installed him on the throne formerly occupied by Teumman Prism A iii 44 // F ii 67 = Borger (1996) 38. 
In 653, during his second campaign against the Gambulu, Assurbanipal captured Nabû-na’id and Bel-e#ir, sons of Nabû-šumu-ereš, governor of Nippur, whose father had encouraged mur-ta-ku // mur-ta-ki to invade Babylonia; they were forced to crush their father’s bones Prism B vi 95 // C vii 113 = Borger (1996) 108. 
A Babylonian letter attributed to Nabû-ušabši mentions mur-ta-gu in a broken context; it goes on to mention Ummanigaš and the death of his father (i.e. Urtaku) ABL 998:1′(not dated). The inscrip-tion on a fragmentary tablet (liver?) mentions [m]ur-ta-gi LUGAL as well as (following a break) Ummanigaš, “his brother” K 13225:4′= Borger (1956) 118 (the text may be better assigned to the reign of Assurbanipal than Esarhaddon).€ Waters (2000) 42-47; Waters (2006) 61ff (on his family relations). 
2. Relative by marriage of Teumman (reign of Assurbanipal): An epigraph on a relief in the pal-ace of Sennacherib at Nineveh relates that mur-[ta]-ku, the (brother or father?)-in-law (ha-ta-nu) of Teumman, was wounded by an arrow during the battle of Til-Tuba and called out to an Assyrian to behead him and thereby make a good name for himself Gerardi (1988) 30, Slab 2; Borger (1996) 302; Russell (1999) 172; for the relief itself see Russell (1999) 175 Fig. 58.

*Urzana (mng. unknown); probably Hurr. or Urar#.; masc.; wr. mur-za-na-a, mur-za-a-ni, mur-za-na, mur-za-ni, mur-za-an-na. This name must be separated from (Iranian-based) Uarzan, although it has often been related to it since Hüsing (1897) 29 and Rost (1897) 113 n. 1. Hurr.-Urar#. connec-tions have been preferred by Streck (1900) 357 n. 1; Tallqvist (1918) 271b; König (1934) 56; Meli-kišvili (1960) 89 (erroneously considering a dia-lectal variant to the name of the Urar#. king Rusâ), etc., without a convincing etymology, however. Thus Grantovskij (1970) 298ff; Grantovskij (1998) 29f; Hinz (1975) 130, 272 (contradicting himself to some extent), and Zadok (1997a) 214 n. all still regarded OIran. Va=zana-(the agent noun to the root Med. varz “to do, bring about etc.”) as the source. See now Schmitt (2009) 177f. 
Ruler of Mu$a$ir (reign of Sargon II): As ruler of Mu$a$ir, Urzana was caught in an invidious position with regard to his more powerful neigh-bours, Urar#u and Assyria, because it was in his city that the principal shrine of Haldi, the Urar#ian national deity, was located. His dilemma is exem-plified by the letter SAA 5 147: although the As-syrians expected him to prevent the Urar#ian mag-nates and king from attending the Haldi temple in Mu$a$ir, he protested that he was unable to do so. 
a. In the royal inscriptions of Sargon: The An-nals of Sargon refer to [m][ur]-za-na URU.[mu-$a]-$ir-a who transgressed the oath of Aššur and wrote to Ursâ (Rusâ) of Urar#u Fuchs (1994) Ann.149; Sargon mounted a campaign, and on hearing of its approach mur-za-na URU.mu-$a-$ir-a-a fled like a bird into the inaccessible mountain terrain Fuchs (1994) Ann.152; Sargon surrounded the city of Mu$a$ir, residence of the god Haldi, and brought out of it the wife of mur-za-na, his sons and daught-ers, 6,170 people, as well as mules, asses, lives-tock, precious metals and textiles Fuchs (1994) Ann.154. According to a display inscription, as for mur-za-na URU.mu-$a-$ir-a-a, who trusted in Rusâ the Urar#ian, Sargon descended on Mu$a$ir with his forces like a swarm of locusts and he fled to save his life Fuchs (1994) Prunk.72. 
Sargon’s “Letter to Aššur” containing an ac-count of his eighth campaign gives a detailed ac-count of Sargon’s defeat and sack of Mu$a$ir on his return from Urar#u: mur-za-na URU.mu-$a-$ir-a-a transgressed against the oath of the gods and withheld tribute TCL 3:309; because mur-za-na LUGAL did not obey the command of Aššur and did not accept Sargon’s lordship, Sargon plundered his people and commanded the Urar#ian god Haldi to be brought out (of Mu$a$ir) TCL 3 346; Sargon entered Mu$a$ir triumphantly and installed himself like a lord in the palace, residence of mur-za-na TCL 3 350 (similarly Fuchs [1998] IVb:9, where Urzana’s name may be restored); Sargon despoiled the possessions of the palace of mur-za-na and of the god Haldi, as well as (the remainder of) the abundant property in Mu$a$ir TCL 3 408; in a summary passage Sargon recounts that he looted from mur-za-na URU.mu-$a-$ir-a-a his god Haldi and his goddess Bagbartu, as well as numerous possessions of his palace, 6,210 people, twelve mules, 380 asses, 525 oxen, 1,285 sheep, his wife, his sons and his daughters TCL 3 423. A more concise summary account on the Kition Stele and on a cylinder from Nineveh records that Sargon counted as booty mur-za-na MAN URU.mu-$a-$ir // [mur]-za-na LUGAL URU.mu-$a-$i-ri his family (Nineveh cyl.: the people of his land), and his gods Haldi and Bagbartu Kition Stele ii 39 = Malbran-Labat (2004) 347; BM 122614+:15 = Iraq 7 (1940) 87, Fig. 2.€ Mayer (1983) for an edition of Sar-gon’s “Letter to Aššur”. 
b. In the royal correspondence: 1′. In the letters of Assyrian officials: A fragmen-tary letter to the king attributed to Aššur-re$u’a reports that they are building a fort [in ...] because of the governor Kaqqadanu; in a broken passage he writes that mur-za-a-ni [LUGAL] [ša!] KUR.mu-$a-$i[r] has been seized and his people gathered and taken to Waisi. He also reports that Ari$a is on his way to a certain person SAA 5 89:7 (not dated); in a letter to the king it is reported in a broken passage that a messenger of [LÚ*.A—š]ip-ri ša mur-za-na-a [LUGAL KUR.mu]-$a-$i-ri [and a messenger of?] Ari$i have come to the writer SAA 5 112 r. 3 (not dated); another fragmentary letter cites a certain Sanije as having said that mur-za-ni [has left] the town [...] SAA 5 130 r. 7 (not dated); in a letter to the palace herald, Urdu-Sin reports that the Cim-merian king has entered Urar#u; the messenger of the governor of Waisi has gone to mur-[za]-ni to request military assistance for the people of Pulia and Suriana; all of Urar#u is said to be extremely frightened SAA 5 145 b.e. 17 (not dated); in a letter to the king, Šulmu-beli reports that m[ur-za]-na is staying in the town Alamu on the 10th; on the [11th] he will be in Hiptuna, [on the 12th] in Muši, [on the 13th] in Issete(?), [on the 14th in Arb]ail; the remainder of his itinerary is lost SAA 5 136:4 (not dated); a fragmentary letter to the king con-tains a report on Urar#u, mentioning the Cimme-rians; their king is said to be encamped in U$unali. 
The writer says that he has written to mur-za-na asking him to send a detailed report SAA 5 144 r. 9 (not dated); a letter to the king reports on the Urar#ian (king), saying that the brother of mur-za-n[a-a] has come to Šulmu-beli; details of what Urzana’s brother said are lost SAA 5 148:9 (not dated); in a letter to the king attributed to his son Sennacherib, it is reported that Šulmu-beli, the deputy of the palace herald, came to the writer and said that mur-za-an-na had written to him with the news that the troops of the Urar#ian king had been defeated on his expedition against the Cimmerians, and the governor of Waisi had been killed SAA 1 30:4 (not dated); a small fragment of a letter men-tions [mur]-za-[ni] and some forts SAA 5 187:1 (not dated). 
2′. As the author of letters to the king and the palace herald: mur-za-na-a writes to the king about his difficulties in bringing oxen and rams to the king (presumably as audience gifts); he apparently does not have the animals to hand, and the road is blocked by snow SAA 5 146:2 (not dated); mur-za-na-[a!] writes to the palace herald who has asked him for a report on the movements of the Urar#ian king. He explains that the governor of Waisi and the governor next to the Ukkean have come and are doing service in the temple; they say that the (Urar#ian) king is on his way, and more governors are coming to Mu$a$ir to perform service. The palace herald has previously told him that no-one should participate in the service without the per-mission of the (Assyrian) king. Urzana protests that, as he was unable to hold back the Assyrian king when he came here (to Mu$a$ir), how can he be expected to hold back this one (i.e the Urar#ian king)? SAA 5 147:1 (not dated). These letters must be dated after Urzana submitted to Sargon during the latter’s eighth campaign of 714; see Lanfran-chi -Parpola (1990) xvii. 
c. In the inscriptions on stelae of Rusâ son of Sarduri: The bilingual (Urar#ian/Assyrian) stele of the Urar#ian king Rusâ son of Sarduri from Movana describes an attack by Rusâ on Mu$a$ir. Two fur-ther bilingual stelae, from Topzawa and Mergeh Karvan, bear a very similar text of Rusâ son of Sarduri but are more poorly preserved than the Movana stele. It remains a matter for discussion whether the events described in these stelae in-scriptions took place before or after Sargon’s sack of Mu$a$ir in 714: The king of Mu$a$ir is said to have closed the gate of the Haldi temple and fled to Assyria; the text on the Topzawa stele mentions him by name at this point: [mu]r-za-na-[a] closed the gate of the temple before him (Rusâ) and fled to Assyria Topzawa r. 11′= CTU 507 (A 10-5). He apparently then returned, and Rusâ records that he [...] against mur-za-na-a // m[ur-z]a-na-[a] // m[ur]-za-[na-a] Movana iii 43′= CTU 501 (A 10-3) // Mergeh Karvan r. 16′= CTU 504 (A 10-4) // Topzawa r. 13′= CTU 507 (A 10-5); mur-za-na-a // mur-za-[na]-[a] (Topzawa) prepared to do battle against Rusâ Movana iii 44′= CTU 501 (A 10-3) // Mergeh Karvan r. 17′= CTU 504 (A 10-4) // Topzawa r. 17′= CTU 507 (A 10-5); Rusâ defeated him on Mt. Andarutu but then he took [mur]-za-na // [mur-za]-na-a by the hand and restored him to his former position as king Movana iii 47′= CTU 501 (A 10-3) // Topzawa r. 17′= CTU 507 (A 10-5). Rusâ remained in Mu$a$ir for some time and per-formed sacrifices to Haldi. 
d. In the caption to Urzana’s royal seal: The legend on a seal identifies it as the seal of mur-za-na LUGAL KUR.mu-$a-$ir TCL 3 p. xii:1.€ Collon (1987) 86f, no. 405 (on the cylinder seal, which is of Assyrian type, and its legend).

*Ušrâ (shortened name containing ušra-“camel”); Iran.; masc.; wr. muš-ra-a. An Iran. origin was considered by, for example, Justi (1895b) 377a (reading “Wusra”); Meyer (1909) 6; Tallqvist (1918) 244b, 272b; Cameron (1936) 154. However, only D′jakonov (1956) 222 fn. recon-structed a concrete form, OIran. (Med.) Ušraya-(a hypocor. derived from ušra-“camel”; cf. Dia-konoff [1970] 111 n. 37; Grantovskij [1970] 325; Hinz [1975] 248 [*Ušraya-]). Since there is no need to read the NA form as “Ušraia” (as D′jako-nov did), it is sufficient and more economical to trace the form back to Med. Ušra-(with šr being simplified to šr), a name which corresponds exactly to YAv. Uštra-(see Mayrhofer [1977] 86 no. 331) and is best explained as a shortened form based on compounds with Med. ušra-“camel” (= Av. uštra-, OPers. uša-) like the famous (but ambiguous) Av.

Tallqvist (1918) 245a, 272b already suspected that the name was of foreign origin, but only recently Zadok (1996a) 12; Zadok (1997f) 7 established that it goes back to Med. Hu-sravah-(nom. -*va) “with good fame”, which is the equivalent of Ved. Su-srávas-and OPers. U-çavah-reflected in Elam. Ú-iš-šu-ma (cf.

*Uzakku (hypocor.); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-zak-ku. This foreign name (cf. Tallqvist [1918] 245a, 265a, 266b s.v. akku) was interpreted as Uzaka-by Grantovskij (1970) 236f, who related it to the roots Av. aoz-“to respect” (which, however, does not exist) or vaz-“to drive, ride”. More satisfactory from the morphological point of view is OIran. 
*Au!a-ka-, hypocor. to Iran. au!ah-(= Av. aojah-) “strength”, as Zadok (1996a) 13 would have it. The same has also been assumed for Elam. U-za-ak-qa by Mayrhofer (1973) 250 no. 8.1786 and Hinz (1975) 51. See now also Schmitt (2009) 181f.

<<H. Baker >>.
*Uzî (hypocor.); Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-zi-i. Tall-qvist (1918) 265a regarded an Iran. origin as possible and compared (apart from Hebr. ’ûzay, in which Scheftelowitz [1901] 72 had also recog-nized the Iran. name) YAv. Uziia-(cf. Grantovskij [1970] 237; Grantovskij [1971] 295), which name is quite unclear, however. Grantovskij (1970) 237 tried to derive Uzî (like Uzakku) from Av. “aoz-” or vaz-, but in the case of this name too it is preferable to start from OIran. au!ah-“strength” (as for Uzakku) and to assume a hypocor. forma-tion in -iya-, Au!-iya-. On the other hand, König (1934) 56 doubted an Iran. derivation. Cf. Schmitt (2009) 182.
Ruler of Mali (reign of Sargon II): mú-zi-i ša URU.ma-a-li is one of the rulers who bring tribute to Sargon in 714, according to the account of his eighth campaign TCL 3:43. 
<<H. Baker >>.
*Uzitar (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mú-zi-tar. Tallqvist (1918) 245a, 265a related this foreign name only to Uzî. König (1934) 56 was certainly correct to question OIran. Hu-cira-“of good lineage” (because of -z-), but did not have sufficient evidence for assuming a Caspi-an or Hurrian origin. Grantovskij (1970), who (p. 237) saw in -tar the reflex of an agent noun in Iran. -tar-or a comparative formation in -tara-, could only speculate (p. 318) about OIran. Vazitar-or Uzitar-(which are falsely reconstructed anyway). Thus all remains unclear. Cf. Schmitt (2009) 182f. Ruler of Qantau (reign of Sargon II): mú-zi-tar ša URU.qa-an-ta-a-ú is one of the rulers who bring tribute to Sargon in 714, according to the account of his eighth campaign TCL 3:45.

*Uzumanda (“Powerful”); perhaps Iran.; masc.; wr. mú-zu-ma-an-da. The name is possibly Iran. (see Tallqvist [1918] 245a, 265a), and in support of this view Grantovskij (1970) 237 referred to OIran. names such as 'Ariom£ndhj or fem. Mand£nh “cheerful”; however, he himself expressed doubt (p. 318) about the Iran. character of the name. Only Schmitt (2009) 183f has expounded a satisfactory Iran. interpretation: thematicized OIran. Au!ahvanta-, based on the inherited adjective OIran. au!ah-vant-(A v. aojorhuuan. t-, aojarv-han. t-) “powerful, vigorous” = Ved. ójas-vant-.

*Zabanu (mng. unknown); origin unknown; masc.; wr. mza-ba-nu. The view that this name is of Iran. origin goes back to Scheftelowitz (1905) 275 (cf.

4. Babylonian astrologer (reign of Esarhaddon): Zakiru writes several Neo-Babylonian astrological reports to the Assyrian king; a small number of these also contain private matter.

*Zakutu (“Pure”); Akk.; fem.; wr. MÍ.za-ku-tú, MÍ.za-ku-u-te, MÍ.za-ku-te; Tallqvist (1918) 246. Zakutu was also known by the Aram. equivalent of her name, Naqi’a.
Queen of king Sennacherib, mother of king Esar-haddon, also known as Naqi’a:
a. In votive inscriptions on behalf of Esarhad-don: In a dedicatory inscription to the goddess Mullissu for the life of Esarhaddon and her own life, MÍ.za-ku-tú calls herself “queen (MÍ—É.GAL) of Sennacherib, ..., daughter-in-law of Sargon, ... and mother of Esarhaddon” ADD 645:2 = RINAP 4 2006 r. 2 (not dated). On the reverse of the tablet is a similar dedicatory inscription to Ištar of Nine-veh written in the name of Naqi’a; see Melville (1999) 43, 99f. In a dedicatory inscription on a bead, MÍ.za-ku-tú calls herself “queen (MÍ—É.GAL) of Sennacherib, king of Assyria”; she dedicates the object to a deity (name lost) for the life of her son, king Esarhaddon, and for her own life RINAP 4 2007:2; see Melville (1999) 100 (erroneously as-cribing the bead to Naqi’a). 
b. In the Zakutu treaty: In 669, at the very begin-ning of his reign, Zakutu drew up a loyalty agree-ment on behalf of her grandson Assurbanipal in order to safeguard his succession to the throne: The heading of the tablet refers to the text as “The treaty of MÍ.za-ku-u-te, queen (MÍ.KUR) of Sen-nacherib, king of Assyria, mother of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, with Šamaš-šumu-ukin, his equal brother, with Šamaš-metu-uballi# and the rest of his brothers, ...” SAA 2 8:1; the various gods are invoked to punish(?)

Zananu see Zannanu. 
*Zanasana (compound with zana-“tribe, race, people”); Iran.; masc.; wr. mza-na-sa-na. Notwith-standing the view of König (1934) 33 (who con-sidered it a Hurr. name), this name is certainly of Iran. origin and renders something like OIran. (Med.) Zana:sa:na-. Since NA -s-does not stand for Iran. xš nor for c, reconstructions such as OIran. Zana-xšana-“possessing or ruling people/tribes” (cf. Justi [1895] 379a, 509; subse-quently Tallqvist [1918] 282a; D′jakonov [1956] 262 n. 3) or Zana-canah-(nom. -na) “longing for people (or similar)” (cf. Grantovskij [1970] 213 n. 33) cannot be maintained. Moreover, the com-parison with Ved. k$an “to wound, hurt” drawn by Tallqvist (1918) XXIV (and Scheftelowitz [1905] 276, if this is what he intended) and the form OIran. Zana:zana-proposed by Hinz (1975) 276 (who saw therein the second element of toponyms such as NPers. Xur-asan “[the land of] the rising sun”) are rather problematic for phonological or semantic reasons (and because the interpretation of Herzfeld [1935] 29 is completely untenable). The least objectionable interpretation, then, is the one considered by Grantovskij loc. cit., who referred to the root OIA as “to eat” and to nominal forma-tions such as OIA asa-“eating” or ásana-“food” and thus roughly thought of Zanasana-“provid-ing the people with food”. One could suppose also a patronymic in -ana-based on Zanasa-“de-vouring people”, which formation would have a full morphological parallel in Av. kahrkasa-(< kahrka-asa-) “vulture”, lit. “devouring chicken”. In any case, OIran. (Med.) zana-“tribe, race, people” seems quite certain as the first element. See now, in greater detail, Schmitt (2009) 185-7.

*Zanzar (mng. unknown); perhaps Iran.; masc.; wr. mza-an-zar. For this name (which was not indi-cated as foreign by Tallqvist [1918] 247a) Gran-tovskij (1970) 213f considered deriving it from (an allegro variant to) OIran. Zanazar(a)-. In this compound he saw the first element Med. zana-“tribe, race, people” as in a number of Iran. (see Zanasana) and OIA anthroponyms. For the second element he referred to the root OIA jar = Iran. zar “to move” (which, however, does not exist), but also to the Av. names Jaro.dar,hu-“watching over the land”, Jaro.varhu “watching over the good/the good ones” (see Mayrhofer [1977] 55 nos. 194f) that might possibly belong to the root I-Iran. !ar “to be awake, watch over”. In all, his explanation “protecting the people/tribes” is not completely compelling. Cf. also Schmitt (2009) 187f.

Ruler of the Chaldean tribe Bit-Ša’alli (reign of Tiglath-pileser III): In the course of Tiglath-pileser’s campaign against the Chaldeans of south-ern and central Babylonian in 730, mza-qi-ru DUMU—mšá-’a-al-li is said to have broken his oath of loyalty with the Assyrians and joined with the enemy; he was captured with his nobles, placed in iron fetters and taken to Assyria. The people of Bit-Ša’alli retreated in fear to their royal city, the fortress Dur-Balihaia, which Tiglath-pileser then captured and plundered Tadmor (1994) Summ.7:19 (not dated); in another royal inscrip-tion Tiglath-pileser claims to have destroyed (the tribes) [Bit-Šilla]ni and Bit-Ša’alli and captured Nabû-ušabši and mza-qi-ru, their kings Tadmor (1994) Summ.11:12 (not dated).

*Zardukka (hypocor.); Iran.; masc.; wr. mza-ar-du-ka-a, mza-ar-duk-ka, mza-ar-du-uk-ku. This clearly Iran. name has been almost unanimously analysed as containing the Iran. word for “heart” (Med. z=d-= Av. z!r!d-) and the hypocor. suffix -uka-, thus as OIran. (Med.) Z=d-uka-since Tall-qvist (1918) 266b, 282b (cf. Grantovskij [1970] 253; Hinz [1975] 279, whereas Eilers [1964] 190 n. 38 was undecided). In view of the NA spelling za-ar-perhaps a form with full grade (*Zard-uka-) or lengthened grade (*Zard-uka-) should not be excluded. I. Gershevitch apud Zadok (1976e) 387b, as for a number of similar names attested in Elamite, proposed Z=d-vahu-ka-“good-hearted”, which however is morphologically impossible. Grantovskij (loc. cit.) and Hinz (loc. cit.) com-pared also Gk. ZardËkhj (attested for Paphlagonia by Strabo 12, 3, 25), which is more likely to be a local name. All considerations based on the for-mer, but now obsolete (see Levine [1972] 50) read-ing Hardukka in Sargon’s Annals (e.g. those re-garding the often-repeated identification with Gk. 'Art⁄kaj of Ctesias, for which cf. still Hinz [1975] 216) have long been rendered invalid (see already Eilers [1940b] 203; R. Schmitt apud Mayrhofer [1973] 292). See now also, in greater detail, Schmitt (2009) 188f. 
Median ruler of the town Harziani (reign of Sar-gon II): m[za]-ar-du-ka-a šá URU.ha-ar-zi-a-ni brought tribute to Sargon’s camp in the land of Sakâ during his campaign to Media in 716 Najafe-habad ii 62 = Levine (1972) 42; according to the report of Sargon’ s eighth campaign, mza-ar-du-uk-ku ša URU.ha-ar-zi-a-nu and several other rulers brought horses, mules, camels, cattle and sheep as tribute to the king in Parsuaš in 714 TCL 3:49; mza-ar-duk-ka ša KUR.h[a]-ar-zi-a-nu is among the rulers who brought tribute to Sargon after his vic-tory in Ellipi in 713 Fuchs (1998) VIb:29′.€ Mayer (1984) 123 (on the location of Harzianu in Parsuaš or Media).

2. Eponym of the tribe of Bit-Zerî, featuring in the expression “son of Zerî” as a name or nickname for Marduk-apla-iddina II (reign of Sargon II): Zerî was apparently the ancestral head of the tribal group called Bit-Zerî. As such, “son of Zerî” seems to have been used to refer to Marduk-apla-iddina II (Merodach-baladan) in a manner directly parallel to “son of Iakin” (mar Iakin), used to denote him as leader of the tribe of Bit-Iakin; see Fuchs -Parpola (2001) xv. In the Babylonian correspond-ence of Sargon the Babylonian name form Zeria is found in parallel contexts.

*Zarišu (a patronymic); Iran.; masc.; wr. mza-ri-šú. An Iran. origin of this name has been assumed since Hüsing (1900) 565 (cf. Tallqvist [1918] XXII, 247a, 282b; also König [1934] 54, though with incautious further combinations). Scheftelo-witz (1905) 275 considered OIran. Zarša-(for-mally = OIA Har$a-), which he connected with the root Av. zarš, OIA har$ “to get excited, be happy”. 
However, for formal and onomastic reasons this idea is not convincing (cf. Grantovskij [1962] 258). According to Grantovskij loc. cit. and Gran-tovskij (1970) 214 (see also Hinz [1975] 277) it is to be derived from OIran. (Med.) Zarica-“yel-low, golden” and equivalent to YAv. Zairica (the controversial name of a demon, now read Zarica-by Pirart [1995] 22, 411f) and fem. Zairici-Yt. 13, 139 (which belongs to masc. Zairiian. c-, however). 
Most likely, and incontestable on formal grounds, seems to be the interpretation as a patronymic formation OIran. Zarica-based on Zarianc-(= ∩
Y Av. Zairiian. c-“yellow(ish), golden”; cf. Mayrhofer [1977] 104 no. 412) with the weak stem Zaric-(the base of YAv. Zairic-i-, fem., too). See also Schmitt (2009) 189f.

d. In an administrative document: mNUMUN—DÙ is one of several people listed in an account of precious items; since he follows the crown prince, the vizier, the two commanders-in-chief and Aššur-šarru-u$ur (governor of Que), it seems clear that we are dealing here with the governor of Ra$appa SAA 7 57 i 7 (not dated, but can be dated on prosopographical grounds; note also the men-tion of Dur-Šarrukin in ll. iii 1′and iii 10′).

In case the king should ask why the palace herald should get a bull colos-sus of mNUMUN—DÙ, he provides an explanation which relates to the transportation of the colossi by river. He also says that he has brought a bull colossus of mNUMUN—DÙ to Adia SAA 1 150:13, 19, r. 10 (not dated). In a Babyonian letter Lanšê replies to the king’s command that certain people who are the servants of [m]NUMUN—ib-ni should be given back to him; the sender protests that he does not have any people of mNUMUN—ib-ni in his presence; mNUMUN-ib-ni is mentioned again in a broken context (l. 15); finally the sender proposes to give mNUMUN—ib-ni! soldiers or civilians in-stead, since he does not have any servants of his (Zeru-ibni’s) in his presence SAA 17 96:8, 10, 15, r. 10 (not dated); a fragment of another Babylonian letter, probably also from Lanšê, mentions mNU-MUN—DÙ in a broken context SAA 17 98:2 (not dated).
