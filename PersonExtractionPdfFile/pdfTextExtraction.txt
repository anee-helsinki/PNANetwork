EXTRACTING TEXT FROM THE PDF-FILE (PNA_3_2.pdf)

1. Open the pdf-file in Safari (other browsers Firefox and Chrome were tried, but did not maintain text formatting)
2. Copy all text to Word (text formatting was maintained but typeface not)
	- Remove by hand the page headers and footers
	- With find-and-replace, add '*' to the beginning of lines starting with bold text (i.e. the names of persons)
	- With find-and-replace, add '<<' to the beginning of lines with font size 9 (name of the person who added the persons to the database)
	- Remove line break, by hand, when line end in full stop but the sentence does not end
3. Save file as rdf
5. Open file with TextEdit
	- Remove (automatically) linebreaks when line does not end with full stop
	- Move around, by hand, text snippets that ended in wrong place when two columns in pdf were transformed to one column
	- make sure "nameline" is all one line and description of each person is one line

The resulting text file: ../Lists/pdfAsText

This process took a lot of manual work and small corrections to the text file have been made many times!
